Pulls out Tupperware) I\\n    have never seen one of these intact before.  This is the\\n    famous Dead Sea Tupperware. Listen.  (Pries it open,\\n    makes raspberry sound.)  Ah, still good. (Camera begins\\n    to pan to right.  PEDDLER hurries to catch it.)  Wait,\\n    don\\'t go!  (Stop pan.)I can see that you\\'re only\\n    interested in the exceptionally rare.  I think then, you\\n    would be most rewarded to consider...this.  (PEDDLER\\n    pulls the MAGIC LAMP out from his sleeve.) Do not be\\n    fooled by its commonplace appearance.  Like so many\\n    things, it is not what is outside, but what is inside\\n    that counts.  (Another pan, this one slower to left.\\n    Again, PEDDLER rushes to catch up.)  This is no ordinary\\n    lamp!  It once changed the course of a young man\\'s life.\\n    A young man who liked this lamp was more than what he\\n    seemed.  A diamond in the rough.  Perhaps you would like\\n    to hear the tale?  (PEDDLER pours shiny sand from the\\n    lamp into his hand.)  It begins on a dark night (PEDDLER\\n    throws sand into the sky, where it forms a starry\\n    nightscape.) , where a dark man waits, with a dark\\n    purpose.\\n\\n(Camera tilts down to find JAFAR sitting on his horse and IAGO\\n    on his shoulder.  GAZEEM comes riding up to the pair.)\\n\\nJAFAR:  You...are late.\\nGAZEEM:A thousand apologies, O patient one.\\nJAFAR:  You have it, then?\\nGAZEEM:I had to slit a few throats to get it.  (Pulls out\\n        half of the medallion.  JAFAR reaches out for it,\\n        but GAZEEM yanks it back.)  Ah, ah, ahhh!  The treasure!\\n        (IAGO squawks as he flies by and grabs the medallion.)  Ouch!\\nJAFAR:  Trust me, my pungent friend.  You\\'ll get what\\'s\\n        coming to you.\\nIAGO:   What\\'s coming to you!  Awk!\\n\\n(JAFAR pulls out the second half of the medallion.  He connects\\n    them, and the insect medallion begins to glow.  Finally, it\\n    flies out of JAFAR\\'s hand, scaring the horses, and is off\\n    towards the dunes.)\\n\\nJAFAR:  Quickly, follow the trail!\\n\\n(All ride off, following the glowing speck of light, until\\n    it reaches a large dune.  It separates into two and the\\n    halves plunge into the dune.  All that remains are two glowing\\n    points of light on the dune.  But then the dune begins to rise\\n     up, transforming into a giant lion\\'s head, with the glowing\\n    points serving as the eyes.)\\n\\nJAFAR:  At last, after all my years of searching,  the cave\\n        of wonders!\\nIAGO:       Awk!  Cave of wonders!\\nGAZEEM: By Allah!\\nJAFAR:  Now, remember!  Bring me the lamp.  The rest of the\\n        treasure is yours, but the lamp is mine!\\n\\n(GAZEEM starts to approach the lion\\'s mouth, which forms the\\n    entrance to the cave.  He chuckles as he goes.)\\n\\nIAGO:   Awk, the lamp!  Awk,  the lamp!  (Now that IAGO and\\n    JAFAR are alone, IAGO opens up in normal English.)\\n    Jeez, where\\'d ya dig this bozo up?\\n\\n(JAFAR puts his finger to his lips and shushes him.  GAZEEM reaches\\n    the cave, but is blown away by the roar of the cave\\'s speaking.)\\n\\nCAVE:       Who disturbs my slumber?\\nGAZEEM: It is I, Gazeem, a humble thief.\\nCAVE:       Know this.  Only one may enter here.  One whose\\n        worth lies far within.  A diamond in the rough.\\n\\n(GAZEEM turns to JAFAR with a questioning look.)\\n\\nJAFAR:  What are you waiting for?  Go on!\\n\\n(GAZEEM hesitates, then moves one foot inside the cave.  With\\n    great apprehension, he plants his foot down.  Nothing happens.\\n      Relieved, he begins his trek again.  Then another roar comes.\\n     He turns back, but the lion\\'s mouth slams shut and the dune\\n    collapses back to normal.  All that are left are JAFAR, IAGO,\\n     and the two separated halves of the medallion.)\\n\\nCAVE:       Seek thee out, the diamond in the rough.\\n\\n(IAGO unburied himself from the sand, coughing as he does so.)\\n\\nIAGO:       I can\\'t believe it.  I just don\\'t believe it. We\\'re\\n        never gonna get a hold of that stupid lamp!  Just\\n        forget it.  Look at this.  Look at this.  I\\'m so\\n        ticked off that I\\'m molting!  (He flies up to\\n        JAFAR\\'s shoulder.)\\nJAFAR:  Patience, Iago.  Patience.  Gazeem was obviously\\n        less than worthy.\\nIAGO:       (Extremely sarcastically) Oh, there\\'s a big\\n        surprise.  That\\'s an incred--I think I\\'m gonna have\\n        a heart attack and die from not surprise!  What\\'re\\n        we gonna do?  We got a big problem here,a big prob-\\n        (JAFAR pinches his beak shut.)\\nJAFAR:  Yes, we do.  Only one may enter.  I must find this\\n        one, this...diamond in the rough.\\n\\n(Cut to a rooftop, where ALADDIN rushes up to the edge, carrying\\n    a loaf of bread.  He almost drops it over the edge.)\\n\\nGUARD:  Stop, thief!  I\\'ll have your hands for a trophy,\\n        street rat!\\nALADDIN:    (Looks back, then down, then at the bread.)  All\\n        this for a loaf of bread?\\n\\n(He jumps off, landing on two ropes strung between buildings, with\\n    drying clothes on them.  He skies down them, collecting bits\\n    and pieces of clothing on him as he goes.  Finally, he\\'s\\n    nearing the end of the rope, at a window, when a woman reaches\\n     out and slams the shutters closed.  ALADDIN slams into the\\n    shutters and falls to the street, his fall being broken by\\n    numerous awnings and the pile of clothes around him.  He pulls\\n     off the top layer of clothes and is about to enjoy his bread\\n    when...)\\n\\nGUARD 1:    There he is!\\nGUARD 2:    You won\\'t get away so easy!\\nALADDIN:    You think that was easy?\\n\\n(He looks at three women, laughing at him.)\\n\\nGUARD 1:    You two, over that way, and you, with me.  We\\'ll\\n        find him.\\n\\n(ALADDIN pulls a sheet over him and wraps himself as a disguise.\\n    He rushes over to the women.)\\n\\nALADDIN:    Morning, ladies.\\nWOMAN 1:    Getting into trouble a little early today, aren\\'t\\n        we Aladdin?\\nALADDIN:    Trouble?  No way.  You\\'re only in trouble if you\\n        get caught--\\n\\n(A hand grabs ALADDIN\\'s shoulder and yanks him back.  It\\'s the\\n    first GUARD.  ALADDIN\\'s disguise falls off.)\\n\\nALADDIN:    I\\'m in trouble!\\nGUARD:  ...and this time--(A screeching sound from ABU,\\n        then the guard\\'s turban is pulled down over his\\n        eyes.  ABU dances on the GUARD\\'s head, laughing.)\\nALADDIN:    Perfect timing, Abu!\\nABU:        Hello!\\nALADDIN:    Come on, let\\'s get outta here!\\n        Gotta keep...one jump ahead of the breadline\\n        One swing ahead of the sword\\n        I steal only what I can\\'t afford\\n        That\\'s everything!\\n\\n(ALADDIN battles a GUARD wielding a sword.  He dodges a couple of\\n    swings, then pulls down the GUARD\\'s pants.  ABU raspberries the\\n    GUARD, then dodges an attack.  The GUARD swings at ALADDIN,\\n    but destroys a barrel of fish.  As ALADDIN runs off, the GUARD\\n     pulls a fish over his lower body as a pair of pants.)\\n\\n        One jump ahead of the lawmen\\n        That\\'s all, and that\\'s no joke\\n        These guys don\\'t appreciate I\\'m broke!\\n\\n(ALADDIN and ABU scamper up a pile of barrels, then kick one down\\n    on top of another GUARD.)\\n\\nGUARDS: (one at a time) Riffraff! Street rat!\\n        Scoundrel! Take that!\\nALADDIN:    Just a little snack, guys!\\n\\n(ALADDIN scampers to the top of a platform. The GUARDS shake the\\n    platform back and fro trying to knock him off.)\\n\\nGUARDS: Rip him open, take it back guys!\\nALADDIN:    I can take a hint, gotta face the facts\\n        You\\'re my only friend, Abu!\\nWOMEN:  Who?!?\\n\\n(ALADDIN jumps off the platform to certain death, only to grab ABU\\'s\\n    hands like an acrobat.  The pair swing into a harem.)\\n\\n        Oh, it\\'s sad Aladdin\\'s hit the bottom\\n        He\\'s become a one-man rise in crime\\n\\n(ABU finds a plate full of fruit and stuffs his mouth full like a\\n    chipmunk.)\\n\\nWOMAN:  I\\'d blame parents, except he hasn\\'t got \\'em!\\nALADDIN:    Gotta eat to live, gotta steal to eat\\n        Tell you all about it when I got the time!\\n\\n(ALADDIN and ABU exit.  Cut to MUSCLEMAN flexing to a crowd.  The\\n    GUARDS rush past.  Cut to ALADDIN and ABU behind the MUSCLEMAN,\\n     matching his moves, until they make a mistake and are discovered.)\\n\\n        One jump ahead of the slowpokes\\n        One skip ahead of my doom\\n        Next time gonna use a nom de plume.\\n        One jump ahead of the hitmen\\n        One hit ahead of the flock\\n        I think I\\'ll take a stroll around the block.\\n\\n(A chase sequence, in which ALADDIN and ABU, pursued by the GUARDS,\\n    race through a flock of sheep, hurdle a MAN sleeping on a bed of\\n    nails {of course one extremely large GUARD lands on him}.  ABU\\n     disguises himself with jewels until a SHOPKEEPER discovers him.\\n\\nCROWD:  Stop, thief! Vandal!\\n        Outrage! Scandal!\\nALADDIN:    Let\\'s not be too hasty\\n\\n(ALADDIN is surrounded by GUARDS in front of a door. The door opens\\n    and a large, ugly LADY comes out.)\\n\\nLADY:   Still I think he\\'s rather tasty\\n\\n(ALADDIN tumbles away, then puts his arm around a GUARD, acting\\n    like they\\'re all chums.)\\n\\nALADDIN:    Gotta eat to live, gotta steal to eat\\n        Otherwise we\\'d get along!\\nGUARDS: WRONG!\\n\\n(They all jump into a pile and fight.  When they stop, ALADDIN and\\n    ABU are gone.  They are sneaking away in barrels.  They run\\n    across a flaming pit, followed by GUARDS who hop up and down,\\n    screaming in pain as they cross the rocks.  ALADDIN and ABU\\n    pass a SWORD SWALLOWER, then ABU goes back, pulls the sword\\n    out of the SWALLOWER\\'s mouth.  ABU advances on the guards,\\n    who retreat in fear.)\\n\\nGUARD 1:    He\\'s got a sword!\\nGUARD 2:    You idiot--we\\'ve ALL got swords!!\\n\\n(ABU sets the sword down gently, then runs.  ALADDIN and ABU are\\n    once again surrounded, with GUARDS coming from left and right.\\n      He jumps up and climbs a robe trick being done on the street,\\n     as the GUARDS all crash into each other.)\\n\\nALADDIN:    One jump ahead of the hoofbeats!\\nCROWD:  Vandal!\\nALADDIN:    One hop ahead of the hump!\\nCROWD:  Street rat!\\nALADDIN:    One trick ahead of disaster\\nCROWD:  Scoundrel!\\nALADDIN:    They\\'re quick--but I\\'m much faster\\nCROWD:  Take that!\\n\\n(The GUARDS chase ALADDIN up a staircase into a room.  He grabs a\\n     carpet and jumps out the window)\\n\\nALADDIN:    Here goes, better throw my hand in\\n        Wish me happy landin\\'\\n        All I gotta do is jump!\\n\\n(The GUARDS follow him out the window, but they go straight down to\\n     the street, and land in a pile with the sign \"Crazy Hakim\\'s\\n    Discount Fertilizer.\"  ALADDIN uses the carpet as a parachute\\n    to land safely and out of danger. ALADDIN and ABU high-five each\\n    other.)\\n\\nALADDIN:    And now, esteemed effendi, we feast!  All right!\\n\\n(ALADDIN breaks the bread in two and gives half to ABU, who begins\\n    to eat.  But ALADDIN looks over and sees two young children\\n    rummaging through the garbage for food.  The GIRL sees him, then\\n    drops her find and tries to hide.  ALADDIN looks at them, then\\n    the bread, then at ABU.)\\n\\nABU:        Uh-oh!\\n\\n(ABU takes a big bite of his food, but ALADDIN gets up and walks\\n    over to the children.  The GIRL pulls her brother back.)\\n\\nALADDIN:    Here, go on--take it.\\n\\n(The children giggle with delight.  ABU tries to swallow his bite,\\n    then looks guilty. He walks over to the children and offers his\\n     bread to them.  In delight, they pet him on the head.)\\n\\nABU:        Ah, don\\'t.  Huh?\\n\\n(ABU sees ALADDIN walking into the daylight, where there is a parade\\n    going on.ALADDIN peers over the shoulders of people.  He sees\\n    PRINCE ACHMED riding on a horse.)\\n\\nBYSTANDER 1:    On his way to the palace, I suppose.\\nBYSTANDER 2:    Another suitor for the princess.\\n\\n(ALADDIN is startled as the two children come running out from the\\n    alley. The BOY runs out in front of the PRINCE\\'s horse,\\n    startling it.)\\n\\nPRINCE: Out of my way, you filthy brat!\\n\\n(The PRINCE brings up his whip to attack the children, but ALADDIN\\n    jumps in front of them and catches the whip.)\\n\\nALADDIN:    Hey, if I were as rich as you, I could afford some manners\\nPRINCE: Oh--I teach you some manners!\\n\\n(The PRINCE kicks ALADDIN into a mud puddle. The crowd laugh at him.)\\n\\nALADDIN:    Look at that, Abu.  It\\'s not every day you see a\\n        horse with two rear ends!\\n\\n(The PRINCE stops and turns back to ALADDIN.)\\n\\nPRINCE: You are a worthless street rat.  You were born a\\n        street rat, you\\'ll die a street rat, and only\\n        your fleas will mourn you.\\n\\n(ALADDIN rushes the PRINCE, but the doors to the castle slam shut\\n    in his face.)\\n\\nALADDIN:    I\\'m not worthless.  And I don\\'t have fleas.  Come\\n        on, Abu.  Let\\'s go home.\\n\\n(ALADDIN makes the climb to his home with the view, then tucks in\\n    ABU for the night.)\\n\\nALADDIN:    Riffraff, street rat.\\n        I don\\'t buy that.\\n        If only they\\'d look closer\\n        Would they see a poor boy?  No siree.\\n        They\\'d find out, there\\'s so much more to me.\\n\\n(He pulls back a curtain to reveal the beautiful palace.)\\n\\n        Someday, Abu, things are gonna change.  We\\'ll be\\n        rich, live in a palace, and never have any problems\\n        at all.\\n\\n(Dissolve to same shot during day.  Cut to int. of SULTAN\\'s chamber.\\n     The door bursts open, and PRINCE ACHMED storms in, missing the\\n    rear end of his pants.)\\n\\nPRINCE: I\\'ve never been so insulted!\\n\\nSULTAN: Oh, Prince Achmed.  You\\'re not leaving so soon, are\\n        you?\\n\\nPRINCE: Good luck marrying her off!\\n\\nSULTAN: Oh, Jasmine!  Jasmine!  Jasmine!  (The SULTAN goes\\n        off into the garden looking for his daughter.  He\\n        finds her, but is interrupted by RAJAH, JASMINE\\'s\\n        pet tiger, who blocks him off.  RAJAH has a piece\\n        of the PRINCE\\'s undershorts in his mouth.The SULTAN\\n        grabs the cloth and yanks it out of RAJAH\\'s mouth.)\\n        Confound it, Rajah!  So, this is why Prince Achmed\\n        stormed out!\\nJASMINE:    Oh, father.  Rajah was just playing with him,\\n        weren\\'t you Rajah.  (RAJAH comes over and allows\\n        JASMINE to pet and hug him.)  You were just playing\\n        with that overdressed, self-absorbed Prince Achmed,\\n        weren\\'t you?  (She cuddles with RAJAH, enjoying the\\n        moment, until she looks up at her angry father. )\\n        Ahem.\\nSULTAN: Dearest, you\\'ve got to stop rejecting every suitor\\n        that comes to call.  The law says you...\\nBOTH:       ...must be married to a prince.\\n\\n(They walk over to a dove cage.)\\n\\nSULTAN: By your next birthday.\\nJASMINE:    The law is wrong.\\nSULTAN: You\\'ve only got three more days!\\nJASMINE:    Father,  I hate being forced into this.  (She takes\\n        a dove out of the cage and pets it.) If I do marry,\\n        I want it to be for love.\\nSULTAN: Jasmine, it\\'s not only this law.  (She hands him\\n        the dove, and he puts it back in the cage.) I\\'m not\\n        going to be around forever, and I just want to make\\n        sure you\\'re taken care of, provided for.\\nJASMINE:    Try to understand.  I\\'ve never done a thing on my\\n        own. (She swirls her finger in the water of the\\n        pond, petting the fish.)I\\'ve never had any real\\n        friends. (RAJAH looks up at her and growls.)\\n        Except you, Rajah.  (Satisfied, he goes back to\\n        sleep.)  I\\'ve never even been outside the palace\\n        walls.\\nSULTAN: But Jasmine, you\\'re a princess.\\nJASMINE:    Then maybe I don\\'t want to be a princess.  (She\\n        splashes the water.)\\nSULTAN: Oooohhh!  Allah forbid you should have any\\n        daughters!\\n\\n(RAJAH looks up and thinks for a second.  JASMINE goes to the dove\\n    cage and yanks open the door.  The birds fly off into freedom.\\n      She watches them go.  Cut to int. of SULTAN\\'s chambers.)\\n\\nSULTAN: I don\\'t know where she gets it from.  Her mother\\n        wasn\\'t nearly so picky.  (A shadow falls over him.\\n        He looks up startled and sees JAFAR.)  Ooh, oh.\\n        Ah, Jafar--my most trusted advisor.  I am in\\n        desperate need of your wisdom.\\nJAFAR:  My life is but to serve you, my lord.  (He bows.)\\nSULTAN: It\\'s this suitor business.  Jasmine refuses to\\n        choose a husband.  I\\'m at my wit\\'s-end.\\nIAGO:   (In the parrot voice) Awk!  Wit\\'s-end.\\nSULTAN: Oh, ha ha.  Have a cracker, pretty polly!  (He\\n        pulls a cracker out from his pocket.  IAGO looks\\n        terrified.  Then the SULTAN stuffs it in IAGO\\'s\\n        mouth.  IAGO grimaces as he tries to eat it.  JAFAR\\n        and the SULTAN both laugh.)\\nJAFAR:  Your majesty certainly has a way with dumb animals.\\n        (IAGO glares at him.)  Now then, perhaps I can\\n        divine a solution to this thorny problem.\\nSULTAN: If anyone can help, it\\'s you.\\nJAFAR:  Ah, but it would require the use of the mystic blue\\n        diamond.\\nSULTAN: Uh, my ring?  But it\\'s been in the family for\\n        years.\\nJAFAR:  It is necessary to find the princess a suitor.\\n        (JAFAR says the word \\'princess\\' with the accent on\\n        the second syllable, \"cess.\"  He turns his staff\\n        with a cobra head towards the SULTAN.  The eyes of\\n        the staff begin to glow. The room darkens, JAFAR\\'s\\n        voice slows down and deepens.  The SULTAN\\'s eyes\\n        get a hypnotized look.)  Don\\'t worry.  Everything\\n        will be fine.\\nSULTAN: Everything...will be...fine.\\nJAFAR:  The diamond.\\nSULTAN: Here, Jafar. Whatever you need will be fine.\\n\\n(The SULTAN removes his ring and hands it to JAFAR. The room returns\\n    to normal as JAFAR pulls back the staff.)\\n\\nJAFAR:  You are most gracious, my liege.  Now run along and\\n        play with your little toys.\\nSULTAN: (Still hypnotized)  Yes...that\\'ll be...pretty good.\\n\\n(JAFAR and IAGO exit.  We follow them. When they\\'re out of the room,\\n    the parrot spits out the cracker.)\\n\\nIAGO:       I can\\'t take it anymore!  If I gotta choke down on\\n        one more of those moldy, disgusting crackers...bam!\\n        Whack!\\n\\n(JAFAR pulls a rope, which reveals a hidden entrance to his chambers.)\\n\\nJAFAR:  Calm yourself, Iago.\\nIAGO:       Then I\\'d grab him around the head.  Whack! Whack!\\nJAFAR:  (Speaking over IAGO.)  Soon, I will be sultan, not\\n        that addlepated twit.\\nIAGO:       And then I stuff the crackers down his throat!  Ha\\n        ha!\\n\\n(The pair pass through a door and slam it shut.  Diss. to ext. gardens\\n    at night.  A shadowy figure walks through.  We see it is JASMINE\\n    in disguise.  She reaches the palace wall, then begins to climb it.\\n      She is tugged from behind by RAJAH.)\\n\\nJASMINE:    Oh, I\\'m sorry, Rajah.  But I can\\'t stay here and\\n        have my life lived for me.  I\\'ll miss you.(She\\n        begins to climb again, and is helped up by RAJAH,\\n        who begins to whine and whimper.)  Good bye!\\n\\n(She disappears over the wall. Cut to daytime on the street  ALADDIN\\n    and ABU are up to their capers again.  They are on top of the\\n    awning of a fruit stand.)\\n\\nALADDIN:        Okay, Abu.  Go!\\n\\n(ABU dips over the edge and looks at the PROPRIETOR.)\\n\\nPROPRIETOR: (To passing crowd)  Try this, your taste buds\\n            will dance and sing. (ABU grabs a melon and\\n            hangs there, distracting his attention.)  Hey,\\n            get your paws off that.\\nABU:            Blah blah blah!\\nPROPRIETOR: Why, you!  Get away from here, you filthy ape!\\n\\n(He grabs the melon away from ABU.  But in the foreground, ALADDIN\\n    dips down and snatches another melon from the stand.)\\n\\nABU:            Bye bye!\\n\\n(He zings back up.  The PROPRIETOR takes the melon to the front,\\n    where he places it on top of a stack.  He looks confused, like\\n    he has just done this.)\\n\\nALADDIN:    Nice goin\\' Abu.  Breakfast is served.\\n\\n(ALADDIN and ABU on the roof break open the melon and eat.  We see J\\n    ASMINE walking through the street.)\\n\\nSHOPKEEPER 1:   Pretty lady, buy a pot.  No finer pot in brass\\n            or silver.\\nSHOPKEEPER 2:   Sugar dates, sugar dates and figs!  Sugar\\n            dates and pistachios!\\nSHOPKEEPER 3:   Would the lady like a necklace.  A pretty\\n            necklace for a pretty lady.\\n\\n(She is charmed by the action, but is startled by a fish thrust\\n    into her face.)\\n\\nSHOPKEEPER 4:   Fresh fish!  We catch \\'em, you buy \\'em!\\nJASMINE:    I don\\'t think so.  (She backs away, but bumps into\\n        a fire eater, who is startled into swallowing his\\n        fire.)  Oh, excuse me.  (He gulps, then belches\\n        fire from his mouth.  JASMINE is disgusted.  He is\\n        pleased and taps his stomach.  ALADDIN sees her,\\n        and a strange look comes over his face.)  I\\'m\\n        really very sorry.\\nALADDIN:    (He\\'s obviously deeply in love with her.)  Wow!\\n\\n(She pulls the hood of her cloak over her head.  ABU sees him and\\n    jumps up on his shoulder, waving his hand in front of ALADDIN\\'s\\n    face.)\\n\\nABU:        Uh oh.  Hello?  Hello?\\n\\n(JASMINE stops at the fruit stand and sees a young homeless child\\n    reaching for a piece of fruit.  She picks one up and gives it to\\n    him.)\\n\\nJASMINE:        Oh, you must be hungry.  Here you go.  (The\\n            boy runs off.)\\nPROPRIETOR: You\\'d better be able to pay for that.\\nJASMINE:        (Mystified) Pay?\\nPROPRIETOR: No one steals from my cart!\\nJASMINE:        Oh, I\\'m sorry sir.  I don\\'t have any money.\\nPROPRIETOR: Thief!\\nJASMINE:        Please, if you let me go to the palace, I can\\n            get some from the Sultan.\\nPROPRIETOR: Do you know what the penalty is for stealing?\\n\\n(He takes her hand and pins it down on the table, intending to\\n    chop it off.)\\n\\nJASMINE:        No, no please!\\n\\n(The sword drops, but his hand is stopped by ALADDIN\\'s.)\\n\\nALADDIN:        Thank you kind sir.  I\\'m so glad you\\'ve found\\n            her. I\\'ve been looking all over for you.\\nJASMINE:        (whispering) What are you doing?\\nALADDIN:        (whispering back) Just play along.\\nPROPRIETOR: You know this girl?\\nJASMINE:        Sadly, yes.  She is my sister.  She\\'s a little\\n            crazy.  (He circles his finger around his ear.\\n            She is shocked.  The PROPRIETOR grabs him by\\n            the vest.)\\nPROPRIETOR: She said she knows the Sultan!\\nALADDIN:        She thinks the monkey is the Sultan.\\n\\n(ABU is picking a pocket.  He hears this, then straightens up.\\n    JASMINE, playing along, kneels and bows to ABU.)\\n\\nJASMINE:        Oh, wise Sultan.  How may I serve you?\\nABU:            Well, blah blah blah blah.\\nALADDIN:        Tragic, isn\\'t it?  (He leans forward, picking\\n            up another apple from the cart with his\\n            foot.) But, no harm done.  (Walks over to\\n            Jasmine.)  Now come along sis. Time to see the\\n            doctor.\\nJASMINE:        (To a camel standing nearby) Oh, hello doctor.\\n            How are you?\\nALADDIN:        No, no, no. Not that one. (To ABU, whose\\n            pockets are bulging.) Come on, Sultan.\\n\\n(ABU bows to the crowd and everything he\\'s stolen from the cart falls\\n    out.)\\n\\nPROPRIETOR: Huh?  What is it?  (ABU picks up what he can\\n            carry, and the trio run off.) Come back here,\\n            you little thieves!\\n\\n(Cut to int. of JAFAR\\'s lab.  IAGO is running on a gear in a bizarre\\n    contraption.  At the top of the contraption is a storm brewing.)\\n\\nIAGO:       (huffing and puffing)  With all due respect, your\\n        rottenness, couldn\\'t we just wait for a real storm?\\nJAFAR:  Save your breath, Iago.  Faster!  (He places the\\n        SULTAN\\'s ring in the contraption.)\\nIAGO:       Yes, o mighty evil one.\\n\\n(IAGO runs faster.  A lightning bolt streaks through the ring, passing\\n    into an hourglass below.  The sands begin to swirl.)\\n\\nJAFAR:  Ah, sands of time--reveal to me the one who can\\n        enter the cave.  (The sand in top forms the Cave of\\n        Wonders.  It falls through into a storm, but it\\n        shows ALADDIN climbing up a ladder, followed by\\n        JASMINE who is covered in her cloak.) Yes, yes!\\n        There he is.  My diamond in the rough!\\nIAGO:       That\\'s him?!?!   That\\'s the clown we\\'ve been\\n        waitin\\' for? (IAGO loses his footing and is sucked\\n        into the gears.)\\nJAFAR:  Let\\'s have the guards extend him an invitation to\\n        the palace, shall we?\\n\\n(IAGO goes flying past and slams into the wall upside down.)\\n\\nIAGO:   Swell.\\n\\n(JAFAR laughs hideously, and the camera zooms in on the sandstorm with\\n    ALADDIN in it.  Finally, we dissolve into the real ALADDIN climbing\\n    to the top of the ladder, followed by JASMINE.)\\n\\nALADDIN:    Almost there.\\n\\n(JASMINE climbs over the top, but trips and falls into ALADDIN\\'s arms.\\n    She stands up.)\\n\\nJASMINE:    I want to thank you for stopping that man.\\nALADDIN:    Uh, forget it.  (He grabs a pole.)  So, uh, this is\\n        your first time in the marketplace, huh?\\n\\n(ALADDIN pole vaults to the next building, leaving JASMINE behind.)\\n\\nJASMINE:    Is it that obvious?\\nALADDIN:    Well, you do kinda stand out.  (He stares at her,\\n        still in love.  She returns the look.  But he\\n        realizes what he is doing, and returns to normal.)\\n        I mean, uh, you don\\'t seem to know how dangerous\\n        Agrabah can be. (He lays a plank between the\\n        buildings for her to walk over, but as he is leaned\\n        down, she vaults over his head.  He looks back in\\n        surprise.  She tosses the pole to him.  Both\\n        ALADDIN\\'s and ABU\\'s eyes bulge.)\\nJASMINE:    I\\'m a fast learner.\\nALADDIN:    Right.  C\\'mon, this way.  (They go inside the roof\\n        of a building, dodging planks and beams as they\\n        go.)  Whoa.  Watch your head there.  Be careful.\\nJASMINE:    Is this where you live?\\nALADDIN:    Yep.  Just me and Abu.  Come and go as we please.\\nJASMINE:    Fabulous.\\nALADDIN:    Well, it\\'s not much, (he pulls back the curtain and\\n        exposes the palace) but it\\'s got a great view.\\n        Palace looks pretty amazing, huh?\\nJASMINE:    Oh, it\\'s wonderful.\\nALADDIN:    I wonder what it would be like to live there, to\\n        have servants and valets...\\nJASMINE:    Oh, sure.   People who tell you where to go and how\\n        to dress.\\nALADDIN:    It\\'s better than here.  Always scraping for food\\n        and ducking the guards.\\nJASMINE:    You\\'re not free to make your own choices.\\nALADDIN:    Sometimes you feel so--\\nJASMINE:    You\\'re just--\\nBOTH:       (in unison) --trapped.\\n\\n(They look at each other, realizing that they\\'re perfect for one\\n    another.  But ALADDIN then realizes where he is, and breaks the\\n    look.  He takesthe apple out of ABU\\'s hand and rolls it down his\\n    arm into the hand of JASMINE.)\\n\\nALADDIN:    So, where\\'re you from?\\nJASMINE:    What does it matter?  I ran away, and I am not\\n        going back.\\nALADDIN:    Really?  (He takes a bite from the apple in his\\n        hand, then hands it to ABU, who has a disgusted\\n        look on his face.)\\nABU:        Why you!\\n\\n(ALADDIN walks over and sits next to JASMINE.)\\n\\nJASMINE:    My father\\'s forcing me to get married.\\nALADDIN:    That\\'s--that\\'s awful.  (ABU appears from behind the\\n        princess and tries to steal the apple.) Abu!\\n\\n(ABU races up to a higher point, chattering and cursing as he goes.)\\n\\nJASMINE:    What?\\nALADDIN:    Abu says that--uh--that\\'s not fair.\\nABU:        What?\\nJASMINE:    Oh did he?\\nALADDIN:    Yeah, of course.\\nJASMINE:    And does Abu have anything else to say?\\nALADDIN:    Well, uh, he wishes there was something he could do\\n        to help.\\nABU:        Oh, boy!\\nJASMINE:    Hmm, tell him that\\'s very sweet.\\n\\n(ALADDIN and JASMINE have been getting closer and closer, until\\n    ALADDIN leans in to kiss her.  He is interrupted, however,\\n    by the GUARDS, who have found them.)\\n\\nGUARD:  Here you are!\\nALADDIN and JASMINE:    They\\'ve found me!  (To each other) They\\'re\\n                after you?\\nJASMINE:    My father must have sent them--\\nALADDIN:    Do you trust me?\\nJASMINE:    What?\\nALADDIN:    Do you trust me? (He extends his hand)\\nJASMINE:    Yes. (She takes it.)\\nALADDIN:    Then jump!\\n\\n(They both jump off the roof, fall and land in a pile of salt.  They\\n    try to get away, but the exit is blocked by a GUARD.)\\n\\nGUARD:  We just keep running into each other, don\\'t we,\\n        street rat?\\n\\n(Again, the GUARD\\'s turban is pulled down by ABU, but more guards are\\n    here and block the exit.  The first GUARD pulls ABU off his head and\\n     throws him in a vase.  Three other GUARDS grab ALADDIN.)\\n\\nGUARD:  It\\'s the dungeon for you, boy.\\nALADDIN:    Hey, get off of me!\\nJASMINE:    Let go of him.\\nGUARD:  (Not realizing she is the princess) Look what we\\n        have here, men--a street mouse.  (He throws her\\n        down.)\\nJASMINE:    (standing up and pulling off the hood of her cloak)\\n        Unhand him, by order of the princess.\\n\\n(The GUARDS suddenly stop and bow, forcing ALADDIN to bow as well.)\\n\\nGUARD:  Princess Jasmine.\\nALADDIN:    The princess?\\nABU:        (peeking out from the vase) The princess?\\nGUARD:  What are you doing outside the palace?  And with\\n        this street rat?\\nJASMINE:    That\\'s not your concern.  Do as I command.  Release\\n        him!\\nGUARD:  Well, I would, princess, but my orders come from\\n        Jafar.  You\\'ll have to take it up with him.\\n\\n(The GUARDS drag ALADDIN out, bowing as they go.)\\n\\nJASMINE:    (getting a very pissed-off look) Believe me, I\\n        will.\\n\\n(Cut to int. of palace, JAFAR emerging from his secret chambers.  He\\n    slides the door shut carefully, but the princess comes storming\\n    in before he is finished.  He slams it shut, pinning IAGO inside\\n    the door frame.)\\n\\nJASMINE:    Jafar?\\nJAFAR:  Oh, uh, princess.\\nIAGO:       Awk! Jafar, I\\'m stuck!\\nJAFAR:  How may I be of service to you? (He spreads out his\\n        cape, hiding the door.)\\nJASMINE:    The guards just took a boy from the market, on your\\n        orders.\\nJAFAR:  Your father\\'s charged me with keeping peace in\\n        Agrabah.  The boy was a criminal.\\nJASMINE:    What was the crime?\\nIAGO:       I can\\'t breathe, Jafar!\\nJAFAR:  Why, kidnapping the princess, of course.\\nIAGO:       If you could just--(JAFAR kicks him back inside the\\n        door and it slams shut)--wow, that hurt!\\nJASMINE:    He didn\\'t kidnap me! I ran away!\\nJAFAR:  (Walking away as if shocked) Oh, dear!  Oh, why\\n        frightfully upsetting.  Had I but known.\\nJASMINE:    What do you mean?\\nJAFAR:  Sadly, the boy\\'s sentence has already been carried\\n        out.\\nJASMINE:    What sentence?\\nJAFAR:  (with a sinister tone)  Death.  (JASMINE gasps.)\\n        By beheading.\\nJASMINE:    No!  (She collapses to the floor.)\\nJAFAR:  I am exceedingly sorry, princess.\\nJASMINE:    How could you?  (She runs from the room crying.)\\n\\n(IAGO finally makes it out through the door.  He flies up and lands on\\n    JAFAR\\'s shoulder, coughing.)\\n\\nIAGO:       So, how did  it go?\\nJAFAR:  I think she took it rather well.  (They both get a\\n        sinister smile on their faces.)\\n\\n(Diss. to JASMINE at night, crying at the edge of the fountain.  RAJAH\\n    comes over to comfort her.  She pets him.)\\n\\nJASMINE:    It\\'s all my fault, Rajah.  I didn\\'t even know his\\n        name.\\n\\n(Cut to int. of dungeon.  Rats scurry by, and we descend until we see\\n    ALADDIN chained to the wall.)\\n\\nALADDIN:    (to himself) She was the princess.  I don\\'t believe\\n        it.  I must have sounded so stupid to her.\\nABU:        (from a distance) Yoo-hoo!  Aladdin? Hello!\\n\\n(ABU appears at the window at the top of the dungeon.)\\n\\nALADDIN:    Abu!  Down here!  Hey, c\\'mon--help me outta these.\\n\\n(ABU stops, then begins chattering wildly, dropping to the ground.  He\\n     wraps a cloth around his head and makes his eyes big in an\\n     imitation of the princess.)\\n\\nALADDIN:    Hey, she was in trouble.  Ah, she was worth it.\\n\\n(ABU jumps up on ALADDIN\\'s shoulders and pulls a small set of tools\\n    out of his pocket, then frees ALADDIN.)\\n\\nABU:        Yeah, yeah, yeah.\\nALADDIN:    Don\\'t worry, Abu.  I\\'ll never see her again.  I\\'m a\\n        street rat, remember, and there\\'s a law. She\\'s\\n        gotta marry a prince, she deserves it.\\n\\n(ABU finally frees ALADDIN\\'s hands.)\\n\\nABU:        Ta da!\\nALADDIN:    (Rubbing his wrists) I\\'m a--I\\'m a fool\\nOLD MAN:    You\\'re only a fool if you give up, boy.\\n\\n(We see an OLD MAN sitting in the corner that neither ALADDIN nor ABU\\n    have seen before.)\\n\\nALADDIN:    Who are you?\\nOLD MAN:    A lowly prisoner, like yourself.  But together,\\n        perhaps we can be more.\\nALADDIN:    I\\'m listening.\\nOLD MAN:    There is a cave, boy.  A cave of wonders.  Filled\\n        with treasures beyond your wildest dreams.\\n        Treasure enough to impress even your princess, I\\'d\\n        wager.\\n\\n(Listeners will note that the OLD MAN pronounced the word\\n    \\'princess\\' as \"prin-CESS\" rather than the standard pronunciation\\n     of \"PRIN-cess.\"   The OLD MAN turns his back, and IAGO sticks\\n    his head out of JAFAR\\'s \"old man\" disguise.)\\n\\nIAGO:       Jafar, can ya hurry it up?  I\\'m dyin\\' in here!\\nALADDIN:    But the law says that only a prince can marry--\\nOLD MAN:    You\\'ve heard of the golden rule, haven\\'t you boy?\\n        Whoever has the gold makes the rules.(He grins,\\n        showing a hideously bad mouth.)\\nALADDIN:    So why would you share all of this wonderful\\n        treasure with me?\\nOLD MAN:    I need a young man with strong legs and a strong\\n        back to go in after it.\\nALADDIN:    Ah, one problem.  It\\'s out there, we\\'re in here?\\n\\n(The OLD MAN walks to a wall and pushes open a hidden exit.)\\n\\nOLD MAN:    Mmm, mmm, mmm.,  Things aren\\'t always what they\\n        seem.  So, do we have a deal?\\n\\n(ALADDIN looks at ABU, who shrugs his shoulders.)\\n\\nABU:        Oh, hmm.\\n\\n(Cut to desert scene.  We see ALADDIN leading a horse with the\\n    OLD MAN and ABU on it.  Diss. to cave of wonders.)\\n\\nCAVE:       Who disturbs my slumber?\\nALADDIN:    It is I, Aladdin.\\nCAVE:       Proceed.  Touch nothing but the lamp.\\n\\n(The cave opens up with a roar, and a staircase appears in front of\\n    ALADDIN. )\\n\\nOLD MAN:    Remember, boy--first fetch me the lamp, and then\\n        you shall have your reward.\\nALADDIN:    C\\'mon, Abu.  (to ABU hiding under the shoulder of\\n        his vest.)\\n\\n(ALADDIN begins to descend the staircase.  He reaches the bottom\\n    and enters a golden chamber filled with treasure.)\\n\\nALADDIN:    Would ya look at that!\\nABU:        Uh oh!\\nALADDIN:    Just a handful of this stuff would make me richer\\n        than the sultan!\\n\\n(ABU peeks out, sees the treasure, then bolts for it.)\\n\\nALADDIN:    Abu!\\n\\n(ABU stops in mid run, hovering over a rug on the floor.)\\n\\nALADDIN:    Don\\'t...touch...anything!  We gotta find that lamp.\\n\\n(They begin to make their way through the room when the CARPET rises\\n    off the floor and begins following them.  ABU gets the feeling\\n    they\\'re being followed.)\\n\\nABU:        Huh?\\n\\n(He turns, and the CARPET lies flat on the floor.  He continues, and\\n    the CARPET begins to follow again.  Again, ABU turns back, but the\\n     CARPET is rolled up and leaning against a pile of treasure. ABU\\n     runs to ALADDIN and tugs his pant leg.)\\n\\nABU:        Aladdin!  Aladdin!\\nALADDIN:    Abu, will ya knock it off?\\n\\n(Again the CARPET follows, but this time, when ABU turns, the carpet\\n    jumps to the other side.  It reaches down with a tassel and pulls\\n    ABU\\'s tail.  When ABU jumps around, CARPET again goes to the other\\n     side.  This time, ABU lands in a karate stance.  CARPET reaches\\n    down and plucks ABU\\'s hat off, then puts it on himself.  ABU sits\\n    thinking for a second, until CARPET waves a tassel in front of his\\n     face.  ABU and CARPET both jump scared, and run away.  ABU tackles\\n     ALADDIN and turns his head to look at the CARPET.)\\n\\nALADDIN:    Abu, what are you--crazy?\\n\\n(The CARPET peeks out from behind a pile of treasure.)\\n\\nALADDIN:    A magic carpet!  C\\'mon.  C\\'mon out.  I\\'m not gonna\\n        hurt you.\\n\\n(The CARPET slowly comes out, shyly, then picks up ABU\\'s hat and dusts\\n    it off.  It flies over to ALADDIN and hands the hat to ABU next to\\n     him.  ABU screeches, and jumps onto ALADDIN\\'s shoulder.)\\n\\nALADDIN:    Take it easy, Abu.  He\\'s not gonna bite.\\n\\n(The CARPET again picks up ABU\\'s hat and hands it to him.  ABU shakes\\n    his fist and screeches at it.  CARPET begins to walk away, \"sadly.\")\\n\\nALADDIN:    Hey, wait a minute.  Don\\'t go.  Maybe you can help\\n        us.  (CARPET looks back, excited. It then flies\\n        over and wraps around the pair.)  Hey, whoa!  You\\n        see, we\\'re trying to find this lamp.  (CARPET\\n        motions for them to follow it.)  I think he knows\\n        where it is.\\n\\n(They pass through a long cave, until they emerge in a giant\\n    underground cavern.  In the centre of the room is a tall pillar,\\n     with a staircase going up to it.  It is surrounded by water\\n     with unevenly placed stones forming a bridge.  At the top of\\n    the pillar is a beam of light.  ALADDIN begins to cross the bridge.)\\n\\nALADDIN:    Wait here!\\nABU:        Oh.  Huh?\\n\\n(ABU sees a shrine with a golden monkey.  The outstretched paws hold a\\n    giant ruby.  ABU is hypnotically drawn to it.   ALADDIN climbs the\\n     stairs quickly.  CARPET sees ABU and grabs his tail trying in vain\\n     to hold him back.  ALADDIN finally reaches the MAGIC LAMP.)\\n\\nALADDIN:    This is it?  This is what we came all the way down\\n        here to--  (He looks down and sees ABU break free\\n        of CARPET\\'s hold and lunge toward the jewel.)  Abu-\\n        NO!\\n\\n(ABU grabs the jewel.  There is a rumbling and the room begins to\\n    shake.)\\n\\nCAVE VOICE: Infidels!\\nABU:            Uh oh!\\nCAVE VOICE: You have touched the forbidden treasure.  (ABU\\n               places the jewel back into the paw, but the jewel\\n                and the shrine melt into lava.) Now you\\n                will never again see the light of day!\\n\\n(ALADDIN races down the steps, but they flatten into a ramp, and he\\n    skies down until he flies into the air.  The water has turned into\\n     lava.  He is falling toward it, when all of a sudden CARPET appears\\n    and catches him.   ABU is standing on one of the rocks of the\\n    bridge. He looks left and right and sees rocks exploding into lava.\\n    Then CARPET races over and ALADDIN grabs him, just as the last rock\\n     is exploding.)\\n\\nALADDIN:    Whoa!  Carpet, let\\'s move!\\n\\n(Together, they race back through the caves dodging walls and falling\\n    debris.  ABU grabs ALADDIN\\'s head and covers his eyes.)\\n\\nALADDIN:    Abu, this is no time to panic!  (He pulls ABU off\\n        his head and sees they are flying into a wall.)\\n        Start panicking.\\n\\n(CARPET goes into a dive, then through another cave.  Finally, they\\n    emerge through the internal entrance.  Outside, the cave begins to\\n     growl and close.  CARPET and company are almost to the top when a\\n    boulder drops on carpet, sending it to the floor.  ALADDIN  grabs\\n    onto the rock wall and holds on.  He sees the OLD MAN at the top,\\n    within reach.)\\n\\nALADDIN:    Help me out!\\nOLD MAN:    Throw me the lamp!\\nALADDIN:    I can\\'t hold on.  Give me your hand.\\nOLD MAN:    First give me the lamp!\\n\\n(ALADDIN reaches in and pulls out the MAGIC LAMP.  He hands it up, a\\n    nd the OLD MAN raises it above his head.)\\n\\nOLD MAN:    Ha ha ha ha!  Yes!  At last!  Ha ha ha ha!\\n\\n(ALADDIN has climbed out with the assistance of ABU.  But the OLD\\n     MAN kicks aside ABU and grabs ALADDIN\\'s wrist.)\\n\\nALADDIN:    What are you doing?\\nOLD MAN:    Giving you your reward.  (JAFAR returns to his\\n        normal voice.) Your eternal reward.\\n\\n(He pulls out a crooked dagger and is about to stab ALADDIN, when\\n    ABU bites him on the wrist.  He screams, but lets go of ALADDIN,\\n     who falls into the cave.  OLD MAN throws ABU into the cave as\\n     well.  They fall.  CARPET sees this, but is pinned under a\\n     boulder.  It struggles to break free, then does.  It races\\n     up and catches ALADDIN, but he has already hit the wall several\\n    times, and is unconscious.  On the surface, the cave roars one\\n    final time, then sinks back into the sand.  JAFAR pulls off\\n     his disguise.)\\n\\nJAFAR:  Heh heh heh! It\\'s mine.  It\\'s all mine! I (He can\\'t\\n        find it in his pocket)--- where is it?  No. NO!!\\n\\n(Kiss fade to JASMINE\\'s bedroom.  She is sitting on her bed, next\\n    to RAJAH who looks sad. The SULTAN walks in.)\\n\\nSULTAN: Jasmine?  Oh, dearest.  What\\'s wrong?\\nJASMINE:    Jafar...has...done something... terrible.  (She\\n        looks as if she\\'s been crying.)\\nSULTAN: There, there, there, my child--we\\'ll set it right.\\n        Now, tell me everything.\\n\\n(Cut to int. of cave.  ALADDIN lies unconscious on the CARPET.\\n    ABU tries to wake him.)\\n\\nABU:        Oh, oh. Aladdin?  Wake up.  Aladdin.\\n\\n(CARPET rises up, lifting ALADDIN up.  He awakes slowly.)\\n\\nALADDIN:    Oh, my head. (He looks at the entrance sealed in.)\\n        We\\'re trapped.  (Angry, shaking his fists at the\\n        entrance) That two faced son-of-a-jackal!  (Calmer)\\n        Whoever he was, he\\'s long gone with that lamp.\\nABU:        Aha!\\n\\n(ABU pulls out the MAGIC LAMP.)\\n\\nALADDIN:    Why, you hairy little thief!  Looks like such a\\n        beat-up, worthless piece of junk.  Hey, I think\\n        there\\'s something written here, but it\\'s hard to\\n        make out.\\n\\n(He rubs the LAMP.  Suddenly smoke comes out of the hole, the\\n    LAMP begins to shake and glow, but ALADDIN holds onto the\\n    LAMP, and our wonderful friend, the GENIE comes out.)\\n\\nGENIE:  Aaaaahhhhh!  OY!  Ten-thousand years will give ya\\n        such a crick in the neck!  (He hangs ALADDIN on a\\n        nearby rock.  Then he pulls his head off and spins\\n        it around, yelling as he does so.  CARPET pulls a\\n        ALADDIN down.)  Whoa!  Does it feel good to be\\n        outta there! (GENIE uses the lamp end of himself as\\n        a microphone.) Nice to be back, ladies and\\n        gentlemen.  Hi, where ya from? (Sticks the mic in\\n        ALADDIN\\'s face.)  What\\'s your name?\\nALADDIN:    Uh, Al--uh--Aladdin.\\nGENIE:  (Says his name as if he\\'s discovered something\\n        major) Aladdin! (A neon sign lights up with\\n        ALADDIN\\'s name on it, circled by chase lights.  The\\n        sign changes to reflect the GENIE\\'s upcoming line.)\\n        Hello, Aladdin.  Nice to have you on the show.  Can\\n        we call you \\'Al?\\' Or maybe just \\'Din?\\'  Or how\\n        bout \\'Laddi?\\'  (GENIE disappears, then a dog\\n        wrapped in plaid jumps in.) Sounds like \\'Here, boy!\\n        C\\'mon, Laddi!\\'\\nALADDIN:    (Shaking his head) I must have hit my head harder\\n        than I thought.\\nGENIE:  (Still a dog) Do you smoke?  Mind if I do? (Dog\\n        poofs into smoke, then back to the GENIE.  ABU\\n        screeches wildly.)  Oh, sorry Cheetah--hope I\\n        didn\\'t singe the fur!  Hey, Rugman!  Haven\\'t seen\\n        you in a few millennia!  Slap me some tassel!  Yo!\\n        Yeah! (CARPET flies over and high fives the GENIE.\\n        GENIE looks at ALADDIN.)  Say, you\\'re a lot smaller\\n        than my last master. (Lifts his beer-gut.)  Either\\n        that or I\\'m gettin\\' bigger.  Look at me from the\\n        side--do I look different to you?\\nALADDIN:    Wait a minute!  I\\'m--your master?\\nGENIE:  (Slaps a diploma in ALADDIN\\'s hand and a\\n        mortarboard on his head.)  That\\'s right!  He can\\n        be taught!! What would you wish of me, (as Arnold\\n        Schwarzenegger)  the ever impressive,(inside a\\n        cube) the long contained, (as a ventriloquist with\\n        a dummy) often imitated, (tosses the dummy aside)\\n        but never duplicated--\\n\\n(He multiplies into multiple GENIES who surround him.)\\n\\nDUP. GENIES:    Duplicated, duplicated,  duplicated,\\n            duplicated,  duplicated,  duplicated,\\n            duplicated, duplicated, duplicated.\\nGENIE:  (Says it like a ring announcer at a boxing match.)\\n        Genie!  Of!  The Lamp!  (Goes into Ed\\n        Sullivan)  Right here direct from the lamp, right\\n        here for your enjoyment wish fulfillment.\\n        Thank youuuuu!\\nALADDIN:    Whoa!  Wish fulfillment?\\nGENIE:  Three wishes to be exact.  And ix-nay on the\\n        wishing for more wishes.  (Turns into a slot\\n        machine, arm pulls down and three GENIEs appear in\\n        the windows.)  That\\'s it--three.  (Three GENIE\\n        caballeros come out of the slot.)  Uno, dos, tres.\\n        (Changes into b/w Groucho Marx.)  No\\n        substitutions, exchanges or refunds.  (The duck\\n        drops with the secret word \"Refunds.\\'\\nALADDIN:    (To ABU) Now I know I\\'m dreaming.\\nGENIE:  (Music for \"Friend Like Me\" begins) Master, I don\\'t\\n        think you quite realize what you\\'ve got here! So\\n        why don\\'t you just ruminate, whilst I illuminate\\n        the possibilities.

Then GENIE turns into a pile of fireworks and\\n    explodes.  Then GENIE appears inside lamp and grabs ALADDIN\\'s\\n     hand and rubs lamp with it.)\\n\\n    Mister Aladdin sir\\n    What will your pleasure be?\\n    Let me take your order, jot it down\\n    You ain\\'t never had a friend like me\\n    No no no!\\n\\n(GENIE produces a table and chairs, then writes down things on a\\n    note pad, like a waiter. )\\n\\n    Life is your restaurant\\n    And I\\'m your maitre\\' d!\\n    C\\'mon whisper what it is you want\\n    You ain\\'t never had a friend like me.\\n\\n(GENIE appears as a plate of chicken, then returns to normal,\\n    but enlarges his ear to listen to ALADDIN.  Finally, he explodes\\n     into four duplicate GENIEs.)\\n\\n    Yes sir, we pride ourselves on service\\n    You\\'re the boss, the king, the shah!\\n    Say what you wish, it\\'s yours!  True dish\\n    How about a little more Baklava?\\n\\n(The GENIEs give him a shave, haircut and manicure, then ALADDIN\\n    appears in a comfy chair (eh?)  surrounded by the treasure\\n    and being fanned by women.  The GENIE appears and fills the\\n    screen with baklava.)\\n\\n    Try some of column \\'A\\'\\n    Try all of column \\'B\\'\\n    I\\'m in the mood to help you dude\\n    You ain\\'t never had a friend like me\\n\\n(ALADDIN rises up on a column of food with a giant A on top,\\n    then jumps to another column with a B on top.  He falls off\\n    and is caught by a cushion held by GENIE.  He opens his mouth,\\n    and his tongue turns into a staircase.  A miniature GENIE\\n     dressed like a magician comes out.)\\n\\n(The mini GENIE does a little dance with the GENIE\\'s two giant\\n    hands.  At the end, they surround the mini GENIE and squish\\n    him into nothing.)\\n\\n    Can your friends do this?\\n    Do your friends do that?\\n    Do your friends pull this out their little hat\\n    Can your friends go poof!\\n    Well looky here\\n    Can your friends go Abracadabra, let \\'er rip\\n    And then make the sucker disappear?\\n\\n(The GENIE pulls off his head, duplicates it, then juggles them.\\n    He tosses them to ALADDIN, who juggles with one hand and spins\\n    one of the heads on his fingertip like a basketball.  He tosses\\n     the heads back onto the GENIE, who proceeds to try and pull\\n     himself out of a hat at his base.  He spirals around and around\\n     until he turns into a white rabbit.  The rabbit transforms into\\n    a purple dragon (very reminiscent of Figment from EPCOT Center).\\n     The dragon breathes fire, which turns into three HAREM GIRLS,\\n    who dance around ALADDIN.  Just as he begins to enjoy them,\\n     they disappear.)\\n\\n    So don\\'t you sit there slack jawed, buggy eyed\\n    I\\'m here to answer all your midday prayers\\n    You got me bona fide, certified\\n    You got a genie for a charg? d\\'affairs!\\n    I got a powerful urge to help you out\\n    So what you wish I really want to know\\n    You got a wish that\\'s three miles long, no doubt\\n    So all you gotta do is rub like so, and oh!\\n\\n\\n(GENIE imitates what he is calling ALADDIN, then turns into a\\n    certificate which rolls up and surrounds ALADDIN.

To the other direction, he zaps in four dancing camels,\\n     and a grand finale dancing number ensues.  ABU grabs as much gold\\n     as he can, but the GENIE wraps everything up in a cyclone and\\n    zaps it away until they\\'re all back in the cave.  GENIE has a\\n    neon \"APPLAUSE\" sign on his back.

Buckley) Ah, almost.  There are a\\n        few provisos, a couple of quid pro quos\\nALADDIN:    Like?\\nGENIE:  Ah, rule number one: I can\\'t kill anybody.  (He\\n        slices his head off with his finger.)  So don\\'t\\n        ask.  Rule two: I can\\'t make anyone fall in love\\n        with anyone else.  (Head turns into a big pair of\\n        lips which kiss ALADDIN.)  You little punim, there.\\n        (Lies flat, then gets up and transforms into a\\n        zombie.) Rule three: I can\\'t bring people back from\\n        the dead.  It\\'s not a pretty picture, (He grabs\\n        ALADDIN and shakes him) I don\\'t like doing it!  (He\\n        poofs back to normal.)  Other than that, you got\\n        it!\\nALADDIN:    (Looks at ABU as if plotting) Ah, provisos?  You\\n        mean limitations?  On wishes? (To ABU) Some all\\n        powerful genie--can\\'t even bring people back from\\n        the dead. I don\\'t know, Abu--he probably can\\'t even\\n        get us out of this cave.

All right, you\\n        baaaaad boy,  but no more freebies.\\nALADDIN:    Fair deal.  So, three wishes.  I want them to be\\n        good.

Let\\'s get real\\n        here.  It\\'s not gonna happen.

C\\'est l\\'amour.\\nALADDIN:    But she\\'s the princess.  To even have a chance, I\\'d\\n        have to be a--hey, can you make me a prince?\\nGENIE:  Let\\'s see here.  (Has a \"Royal Cookbook\".) Uh,\\n        chicken a\\'la king? (Pulls out a chicken with a\\n        crown on its head)  Nope.  Alaskan king crab?\\n        (Yanks out his finger, and we see SEBASTIAN the crab from\\n        \"The Little Mermaid\"  clamped on.)  Ow, I\\n        hate it when they do that.  Caesar\\'s salad? (A\\n        dagger comes out and tries to stab him.) Et tu,\\n        Brute?  Ah, to make a prince.  (Looks slyly at\\n        ALADDIN.)  Now is that an official wish?  Say the\\n        words!\\nALADDIN:    Genie, I wish for you to make me a prince!\\nGENIE:  All right!  Woof woof woof woof! (Takes on square\\n        shoulders and looks like Arsenio Hall. Then becomes\\n        a tailor/fashion designer.)  First, that fez and\\n        vest combo is much too third century. These\\n        patches--what are we trying to say--beggar?  No!\\n        Let\\'s work with me here. (He takes ALADDIN\\'s\\n        measurements, snaps his fingers and ALADDIN is\\n        outfitted in his prince costume.)  I like it, muy\\n        macho!  Now, still needs something.  What does it\\n        say to me?  It says mode of transportation.  Excuse\\n        me, monkey boy!  Aqui, over here!  (ABU tries to\\n        cover himself with CARPET, but GENIE zaps him and\\n        he flies over.)\\nABU:        Uh oh!\\nGENIE:  Here he comes, (ALADDIN and GENIE are on a game\\n        show set, where ALADDIN stands behind a podium with\\n        \"AL\" on it.)  And what better way to make your\\n        grand entrance on the streets of Agrabah, than\\n        riding your very own brand new camel!  Watch out,\\n        it spits!  (A door bearing the GENIE\\'s head on it\\n        opens, where ABU is transformed into a camel.  He\\n        spits out the side of his mouth on cue.  But the\\n        GENIE\\'s not sure.)  Mmm, not enough.  (He snaps his\\n        fingers and ABU turns into a fancy white horse.)\\n        Still not enough.  Let\\'s see.  What do you need?\\n        (The GENIE snaps his fingers repeatedly, turning\\n        ABU into:  a duck, an ostrich, a turtle, and a \\'57\\n        Cadillac, with license plate \"ABU 1.\"   (That one\\'s\\n        a guess, I don\\'t know cars, but judging by the tail\\n        fins, \\'nuff said.)  Finally, he\\'s returned to\\n        normal.)  Yes!!  Esalalumbo,  shimin dumbo!  Whoa!!\\n        (And on the keyword of the spell, Dumbo, ABU turns\\n        into an elephant.  CARPET struggles to get out from\\n        under ABU\\'s size 46 feet.)  Talk about your trunk\\n        space, check this action out!\\n\\n(ABU sees his reflection in a pool of water, then jumps into a tree.\\n     The tree naturally bends right back down to the ground, where ABU\\n     hangs on and looks at ALADDIN upside down.)\\n\\nALADDIN:    Abu, you look good.\\nGENIE:  He\\'s got the outfit, he\\'s got the elephant, but\\n        we\\'re not through yet.  Hang on to your turban,\\n        kid, cause we\\'re gonna make you a star!\\n\\n(We zoom out slowly with the oasis in the distance, as fireworks\\n    begin to explode outward.  Cut to a CU of a pile of toys.\\n    (Look for the BEAST here.)  We tilt up and see the SULTAN\\n    balancing them.  He carefully balances the last piece on top,\\n     then sits back and sighs.  JAFAR storms in, though, and the\\n    pile collapses.)\\n\\nJAFAR:  Sire, I have found a solution to the problem with\\n        your daughter.\\nIAGO:   Awk!  The problem with your daughter!\\nSULTAN: Oh, really?\\nJAFAR:  (Unrolling a scroll) Right here.  \"If the princess\\n        has not chosen a husband by the appointed time,\\n        then the sultan shall choose for her.\"\\nSULTAN: But Jasmine hated all those suitors!  (He tries to\\n        stuff a cracker into IAGO\\'s mouth.  IAGO backs\\n        away.  The SULTAN absentmindedly pulls the cracker\\n        back.)  How could I choose someone she hates?\\n        (IAGO is relieved, but the SULTAN quickly stuffs a\\n        cracker in his mouth.)\\nJAFAR:  Not to worry, my liege.  There is more.  If, in the\\n        event a suitable prince cannot be found, a princess\\n        must then be wed to...hmm...interesting.\\nSULTAN: What?  Who?\\nJAFAR:  The royal vizier!  Why, that would be...me!\\nSULTAN: Why, I thought the law says that only a prince can\\n        marry a princess, I\\'m quite sure.\\nJAFAR:  Desperate times call for desperate measures, my\\n        lord.  (He pulls out the staff and hypnotizes the\\n        SULTAN with it.)\\nSULTAN: Yes...desperate measures...\\nJAFAR:  You will order the princess to marry me.\\nSULTAN: I...will order...the princess...to...(the spell\\n        breaks momentarily)...but you\\'re so old!\\nJAFAR:  (Holds the staff closer) The princess will marry\\n        me!\\nSULTAN: The princess will marry...(the spell is again\\n        broken, this time by the trumpet fanfare of \"Prince\\n        Ali\".)  What? What is that?  That music!  Ha ha ha.\\n        Jafar., you must come and see this!\\n\\n(We see an advancing parade, led by what appears to be the GENIE in\\n    human form as a MAJOR.)\\n\\nMARCHERS:   Make way for Prince Ali!\\nSWORDSMEN: Say hey!  It\\'s Prince Ali!\\nMAJOR:  Hey, clear the way in the old bazaar,\\n    Hey you, let us through, it\\'s a bright new star,\\n    Now come, be the first on your block to meet his eye!\\n    Make way, here he comes,\\n    Ring bells, bang the drums.\\n    You\\'re gonna love this guy\\n\\n(The MAJOR mingles amongst different crowd members.)\\n\\n    Prince Ali, fabulous he, Ali Ababwa!\\n    Genuflect, show some respect\\n    Down on one knee\\n\\n(ABU the elephant marches through town, with ALADDIN (ALI) on his back.)\\n\\n    Now try your best to stay calm\\n    Brush up your Sunday Salaam\\n    And come and meet his spectacular coterie.\\n\\n(IAGO is dancing to the music until JAFAR glares at him.  The\\n    MAJOR \"wheelbarrows\" six men up onto ABU\\'s trunk.

She\\n    humphs it off, then leaves.)\\n\\nCHORUS: He\\'s got ninety-five white Persian monkeys!\\n    (He\\'s got the monkeys, let\\'s see the monkeys!)\\n    And to view them, he charges no fee!\\n    (He\\'s generous, so generous)\\n    He\\'s got slaves, he\\'s got servants and flunkies!\\n    (Proud to work for him)\\n    They bow to his whim, love serving him\\n    They\\'re just lousy with loyalty to Ali!  Prince Ali!\\n\\n(ALADDIN throws gold coins out to the people, who rush over to\\n    collect them.  ABU and the parade march up the steps of the\\n    palace and inside.  The SULTAN runs back inside to the door\\n    to the throne room, but JAFAR stands in front of the door.\\n    Suddenly, it bursts open, with ABU leading the way, and crushing\\n     JAFAR and IAGO behind the door.)\\n\\nGENIE:  Prince Ali!\\n    Amorous he!  Ali Ababwa\\n    Heard your princess was a sight lovely to see!\\n    And that,good people, is why\\n    He got dolled up and dropped by\\n    With sixty elephants, llamas galore\\n    With his bears and lions\\n    A brass band and more\\n    With his forty fakirs, his cooks, his bakers\\n    His birds that warble on key\\n    Make way for Prince Ali!\\n\\n(More and more fanfare build up until ALADDIN flies off ABU\\'s back\\n    on MAGIC CARPET and flies down to the SULTAN.  JAFAR slams the\\n     door shut.)\\n\\nSULTAN: (Clapping) Splendid, absolutely marvelous.\\nALADDIN:    (Takes on a deeper voice.)  Ahem.  Your majesty, I have\\n            journeyed from afar to seek your daughter\\'s hand.\\nSULTAN: Prince Ali Ababwa!  Of course.  I\\'m delighted to\\n        meet you.  (He rushes over and shakes ALI\\'s hand.)\\n        This is my royal vizier, Jafar.  He\\'s delighted\\n        too.\\nJAFAR:  (Extremely dryly) Ecstatic.  I\\'m afraid, Prince\\n        Abooboo--\\nALADDIN:    --Ababwa!\\nJAFAR:  Whatever.  You cannot just parade in here uninvited\\n        and expect to--\\nSULTAN: ...by Allah, this is quite a remarkable device.\\n        (He tugs at the tassels, and they tug his\\n        moustache.)  I don\\'t suppose I might...\\nALADDIN:    Why certainly, your majesty.  Allow me.\\n\\n(He helps the SULTAN up onto the CARPET, and he plops down.\\n    JAFAR pins the CARPET down on the floor with the staff.)\\n\\nJAFAR:  Sire, I must advise against this--\\nSULTAN: --Oh, button up, Jafar.  Learn to have a little fun.\\n\\n(He kicks away the staff and CARPET and SULTAN fly away.  IAGO, who\\n    was standing on the head of the staff, falls down, repeatedly\\n     bopping the staff with his beak as he descends.  SULTAN and\\n    CARPET fly high into the ceiling, then begin a dive-bomb attack,\\n     flying under ABU, scaring him.  The flight continues in the\\n    background, while JAFAR and ALI talk in the foreground.)\\n\\nJAFAR:  Just where did you say you were from?\\nALADDIN:    Oh, much farther than you\\'ve traveled, I\\'m sure.\\n        (He smiles.  JAFAR does not.)\\nJAFAR:  Try me.  (IAGO lands on the staff.)\\nSULTAN: Look out, Polly!\\n\\n(They all duck in time as the CARPET whizzes centimetres over their\\n    heads.  CARPET returns and the SULTAN chases IAGO around the room.)\\n\\nIAGO:       Hey, watch it. Watch it with the dumb rug!\\n\\n(The CARPET zooms underneath IAGO, who sighs, wipes his brow, and\\n    crashes into a pillar.  He crashes to the floor, and his head\\n    is circled by miniature SULTANS on CARPETS, saying \"Have a cracker,\\n    have a cracker.  The real SULTAN begins his final approach.)\\n\\nSULTAN: Out of the way, I\\'m coming in to land.  Jafar,\\n        watch this!  (He lands.)\\nJAFAR:  Spectacular, your highness.\\nSULTAN: Ooh, lovely.  Yes, I do seem to have a knack for\\n        it.  (CARPET walks over to ABU dizzily, then\\n        collapses.  ABU catches it.)  This is a very\\n        impressive youth. And a prince as well.   (Whispers\\n        to JAFAR) If we\\'re lucky, you won\\'t have to marry\\n        Jasmine after all.\\nJAFAR:  I don\\'t trust him, sire.\\nSULTAN: Nonsense.  One thing I pride myself on Jafar, I\\'m\\n        an excellent judge of character.\\nIAGO:   Oh, excellent judge, yeah, sure...not!!!\\n\\n(JASMINE walks in quietly.)\\n\\nSULTAN: Jasmine will like this one!\\nALADDIN:    And I\\'m pretty sure I\\'ll like Princess Jasmine!\\nJAFAR:  Your highness, no.  I must intercede on Jasmine\\'s\\n        behalf.  (JASMINE hears this and gets mad.) This\\n        boy is no different than the others.  What makes\\n        him think he is worthy of the princess?\\nALADDIN:    Your majesty, I am Prince Ali Ababwa! (He pricks\\n        JAFAR\\'s goatee, which springs out in all\\n        directions.)  Just let her meet me.  I will win\\n        your daughter!\\nJASMINE:    How dare you!  (They all look at her surprised.)\\n        All of you, standing around deciding my future?  I\\n        am not a prize to be won!  (She storms out.)\\nSULTAN: Oh, dear.  Don\\'t worry, Prince Ali.  Just give\\n        Jasmine time to cool down.  (They exit.)\\nJAFAR:  I think it\\'s time to say good bye to Prince\\n        Abooboo.\\n\\n(Diss to JASMINE on her balcony at night.  We tilt down and find\\n    ALADDIN and company in the courtyard.)\\n\\nALADDIN:    What am I going to do?  Jasmine won\\'t even let me\\n        talk to her.  I should have known I couldn\\'t pull\\n        off this stupid prince wish.  (ABU struggles with\\n        his elephant paws to open a banana.  He squishes\\n        it, and the banana squirts into his eye.  He then\\n        tosses the banana peel into a heaping pile of the\\n        same.)\\nGENIE:  (to carpet, playing chess) So move!  (CARPET does,\\n        knocking a black piece off the board.)  Hey.\\n        That\\'s a good move.  (As Rodney Dangerfield) I\\n        can\\'t believe it--I\\'m losing to a rug.\\nALADDIN:    Genie, I need help.\\nGENIE:  (as Jack Nicholson) All right, sparky, here\\'s the\\n        deal.  You wanna court the little lady, you gotta\\n        be a straight shooter, do ya follow me?\\nALADDIN:    What?\\nGENIE:  (Back to normal, wearing a mortarboard. He points\\n        out his words on a blackboard)  Tell her\\n        the...TRUTH!!!\\nALADDIN:    No way!  If Jasmine found out I was really some\\n        crummy street rat, she\\'d laugh at me. (He\\n        puts on his turban, which lights up as the GENIE.)\\nGENIE:  A woman appreciates a man who can make her laugh!\\n        (ALADDIN pulls the chain turning off the light.\\n        GENIE comes out holding the real turban.)  Al, all\\n        joking aside, you really oughtta be yourself.\\nALADDIN:    Hey, that\\'s the last thing I want to  be.  Okay,\\n        I\\'m gonna go see her.  I gotta be smooth, cool,\\n        confident.  How do I look?\\nGENIE:  (Sadly) Like a prince.\\n\\n(ALADDIN flies up to the balcony on CARPET.  JASMINE is on her bed,\\n    sighing.  RAJAH is by her side.)\\n\\nALADDIN:    (From a distance) Princess Jasmine?\\n\\n(RAJAH looks up and growls.)\\n\\nJASMINE:    Who\\'s there?\\nALADDIN:    It\\'s me--Prince Ali.  Ahem--(Then he jumps to his\\n        deep voice) Prince Ali Ababwa.\\nJASMINE:    I do not want to see you.\\nALADDIN:    No, no, please princess.  Give me a chance. (RAJAH\\n        growls and advances on him.)\\nJAFAR:  Just leave me alone.\\nALADDIN:    Down kitty!\\n\\n(Over the edge of the balcony, CARPET is watching with GENIE below.)\\n\\nGENIE:  How\\'s our beau doing?\\n\\n(CARPET cuts his neck with his finger.)\\n\\nALADDIN:    Good kitty, take off.  Down kitty. (He takes off\\n        his turban to brush RAJAH away.)\\nJASMINE:    (She looks at him thinking she has seen him\\n        before.)  Wait, wait.  Do I know you?\\nALADDIN:    (Quickly replaces his turban) Uh, no, no.\\nJASMINE:    You remind me of someone I met in  the marketplace.\\nALADDIN:    The marketplace?  (A bee buzzes around his head.)\\n        I have servants that go to the marketplace for me.\\n        Why I even have servants who go to the marketplace\\n        for my servants, so it couldn\\'t have been me you\\n        met.\\nJASMINE:    (She looks disappointed.)  No, I guess not.\\nBEE:        (It\\'s the GENIE) Enough about you, Casanova.  Talk\\n        about her!

You\\'re very...\\nBEE:        Wonderful, glorious, magnificent, punctual!\\nALADDIN:    Punctual!\\nJASMINE:    Punctual?\\nBEE:        Sorry.\\nALADDIN:    Beautiful.\\nBEE:        Nice recovery.\\nJASMINE:    Hmm.  I\\'m rich too, you know.\\nALADDIN:    Yeah!\\nJASMINE:    The daughter of a sultan\\nALADDIN:    I know.\\nJASMINE:    A fine prize for any  prince to marry.\\nALADDIN:    Uh, right.  Right.  A prince like me.\\nBEE:        (Buzzing in his ear) Warning! Warning!\\nJASMINE:    Right, a prince like you.  And every other stuffed  shirt,\\n             swaggering, peacock I\\'ve met!\\nBEE:        (Rear end on fire, wearing goggles and crashing) Mayday!\\n              Mayday!\\nJASMINE:    Just go jump off a balcony! (She turns and walks away)\\nALADDIN:    What?\\nBEE:        Stop her! Stop her! Do you want me to sting her?\\nALADDIN:    (Swats at bee) Buzz off!\\nBEE:        Okay, fine.  But remember--bee yourself! (BEE buzzes into\\n             his turban)\\nALADDIN:    Yeah, right!\\nJASMINE:    What!?!\\nALADDIN:    Uh, you\\'re right.  You aren\\'t just some prize to be\\n        won.  (He looks disappointed.)  You should be free\\n        to make your own choice.  (JASMINE and RAJAH look\\n        at each other in confusion.)  I\\'ll go now. (He\\n        steps up on the ledge and drops off.)\\nJASMINE:    No!\\nALADDIN:    (Pokes his head up from over the edge) What?  What?\\nJASMINE:    (Now she\\'s amazed) How--how are you doing that?\\n        (She looks over the edge and sees the CARPET.)\\nALADDIN:    It\\'s a magic carpet.\\nJASMINE:    It\\'s lovely.  (CARPET takes JASMINE\\'s hand with a\\n        tassel.)\\nALADDIN:    You, uh, you don\\'t want to go for a ride, do you?\\n        We could get out of the palace, see the world.\\nJASMINE:    Is it safe?\\nALADDIN:    Sure.  Do you trust me?\\nJASMINE:    (She looks at him at the saying of that all-\\n        important line) What?\\nALADDIN:    (Extends his hand the same as before) Do you trust\\n        me?\\nJASMINE:    (Gets a sly grin on her face) Yes.\\n\\n(She takes his hand and gets up on CARPET.  It zooms into the sky,\\n    knocking them both into sitting positions.  The music of \"A Whole\\n     New World\" swells.  JASMINE looks back and sees RAJAH looking\\n    up at her questioningly.  She gasps as they fly over the palace\\n     wall and into the sky.)\\n\\nALADDIN:    I can show you the world\\n    Shining, shimmering, splendid.\\n    Tell me princess, now when did you last\\n    Let your heart decide?\\n\\n(CARPET zooms down through the town, stopping slightly to pick a\\n    flower.  It gives the flower to ALADDIN, who gives it to JASMINE.\\n      She smiles.)\\n\\n    I can open your eyes\\n    Take you wonder by wonder\\n    Over, sideways, and under\\n    On a magic carpet ride\\n\\n\\n(CARPET does as ALADDIN sings, then zooms into the clouds.)\\n\\n    A whole new world!\\n    A new fantastic point of view\\n    No one to tell us no\\n    Or where to go\\n    Or say we\\'re only dreaming\\n\\n(JASMINE looks back and watches Agrabah disappear from sight.

It\\n    then circles a pillar of clouds, giving a swirly look to it.)\\n\\nJASMINE:    Unbelievable sights\\n    Indescribable feeling\\n    Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling\\n    Through an endless diamond sky\\n\\n(They join a flock of birds in the sky.  One of them looks terrified\\n    and squawks.  CARPET does somersaults and flips, at times putting\\n    ALADDIN and JASMINE in free-fall, but catching them.  They then\\n    zoom above the clouds where a starry night awaits them.)\\n\\nJASMINE:    A whole new world!\\nALADDIN:    Don\\'t you dare close your eyes\\nJASMINE:    An hundred thousand things to see\\nALADDIN:    Hold your breath--it gets better!\\nJASMINE:    I\\'m like a shooting star,\\n    I\\'ve come so far\\n    I can\\'t go back to where I used to be!\\n\\n(They zoom down over a river, apparently the Nile, for beyond the\\n     ship\\'s sails are the Great Pyramids.  They wave at a worker\\n     sculpting the complete nose of the Sphinx.  He smiles, but\\n    chisels too much and breaks off the front section of the nose.)\\n\\nALADDIN:    A whole new world!\\nJASMINE:    Every turn a surprise\\nALADDIN:    With new horizons to pursue\\nJASMINE:    Every moment, red-letter\\n\\n(They fly alongside wild horses running.

Fireworks burst and we see the couple\\n    at a Chinese New Year celebration, sitting on a rooftop.)\\n\\nJASMINE:    It\\'s all so magical.\\nALADDIN:    Yeah.\\nJASMINE:    (She looks at him and decides to burst the bubble)\\n        It\\'s a shame Abu had to miss this.\\nALADDIN:    Nah.  He hates fireworks.  (CARPET looks up\\n        realizing what is happening.)  He doesn\\'t really\\n        like flying either. (And now ALADDIN realizes it)\\n        That is...oh no!\\nJASMINE:    (She pulls off his turban) You are the boy from the\\n        market!  I knew it.  Why did you lie to me?\\nALADDIN:    Jasmine, I\\'m sorry.\\nJASMINE:    Did you think I was stupid?\\nALADDIN:    No!\\nJASMINE:    That I wouldn\\'t figure it out?\\nALADDIN:    No.  I mean, I hoped you wouldn\\'t.  No, that\\'s not\\n        what I meant.\\nJASMINE:    Who are you?  Tell me the truth!\\nALADDIN:    The truth? (He looks at CARPET who wave him on,\\n        giving up hope.)  The truth...the truth is...I\\n        sometimes dress as a commoner to escape the\\n        pressures of palace life.  (CARPET slumps down in\\n        defeat.)  But I really am a prince! (The feather on\\n         his turban falls down over his eyes.)\\nJASMINE:    Why didn\\'t you just tell me?\\nALADDIN:    Well, you know, um...royalty going out into the\\n        city in disguise, it sounds a little strange,\\n        don\\'t you think?\\nJASMINE:    Not that strange.\\n\\n(She flicks up the feather and cuddles with him.  CARPET puts a\\n    tassel under his \"chin\" and looks mystified.  Dissolve to ext.\\n    of palace balcony, where ALADDIN and JASMINE return.  CARPET\\n    forms a set of steps and she descends.  ALADDIN then descends\\n     just below the balcony.)\\n\\nJASMINE:    Good night, my handsome prince.\\nALADDIN:    Sleep well, princess.\\n\\n(They slowly lean forward to kiss, but CARPET bumps him up and they\\n    kiss sooner than expected.  She walks away slowly then turns and\\n    looks at him. Finally she enters her room through the curtain.)\\n\\nALADDIN:    Yes!  (He falls back onto the CARPET, who descends\\n        to the ground.) For the first time in my life,\\n        things are starting to go right.\\n\\n(He looks up at JASMINE\\'s balcony, and four sets of hands grab him.)\\n\\nALADDIN:    Hey!  What?  (A gag is tied around his mouth.\\n        Muffled words) Abu!  Abu!  (We see the elephant\\n        hanging from a net tied in a tree.)\\nGUARD:  Hold him!\\n\\n(Shackles are placed on his feet and his hands.  Another GUARD ties\\n    CARPET in a knot around a tree.)\\n\\nJAFAR:  I\\'m afraid you\\'ve worn out your welcome, Prince\\n        Abooboo.  (Walks away.)  Make sure he\\'s\\n        never found.\\n\\n(A GUARD hits him in the head, and he falls unconscious.  Cut to a\\n    cliff, where GUARDS laugh as ALADDIN\\'s body drops into the water.\\n      He is conscious now, but his feet are tied to a rock.  The rock\\n     hits the sea bottom, then the turban lands and the lamp tumbles\\n    out.  He sees this and struggles to rub the lamp.  However, he\\n    loses consciousness and falls to the floor.  The lamp, unsettled\\n    by his movement, rolls down and rubs against his hands. It shakes,\\n    and GENIE emerges with a bath brush, rubber duckie, and shower cap)\\n\\nGENIE:  Never fails.  Get in the bath and there\\'s a rub at\\n        the lamp.  (Squeaks the duck)  Hello.  (Sees\\n        unconscious ALADDIN) Al?  Al!  Kid, snap out of it!\\n        You can\\'t cheat on this one!  I can\\'t help you\\n        unless you make a wish.  You have to say  \"Genie I\\n        want you to save my life.\"  Got it?  Okay.  C\\'mon\\n        Aladdin!!  (He grabs ALADDIN by the shoulders and\\n        shakes him.  His head goes up, then falls.)  I\\'ll\\n        take that as a yes.  (Head turns into a siren.)\\n        Wooga!  Wooga!  (Turns into a submarine.)  Up\\n        scope!  (He babbles in something that sounds like\\n        German.  On the surface, a giant water spout\\n        emerges, and lands on top of the cliff.  ALADDIN\\n        reawakes and coughs the water out of his lungs.)\\n        Don\\'t you scare me like that!\\nALADDIN:    Genie, I--uh, I-uh...(He can\\'t think of how to say\\n        it, so they just hug each other.)  Thanks, Genie.\\nGENIE:  Oh, Al.  I\\'m gettin\\' kind of fond of you, kid.  Not\\n        that I want to pick out curtains or anything.\\n\\n(Cut to JASMINE in her room, humming \"A Whole New World\" and brushing\\n   her hair.  The SULTAN appears in one of the double doors,hypnotized.)\\n\\nSULTAN: Jasmine!\\nJASMINE:    Oh, father--I just had the most wonderful time.\\n        I\\'m so happy.\\nSULTAN: (Still monotone from the hypnosis) You should be,\\n        Jasmine. I have chosen a husband for you.\\nJASMINE:    What?\\nSULTAN: (The other door opens and reveals JAFAR.)  You will\\n        wed Jafar.\\n\\n(JASMINE gasps at the sight of him.)\\n\\nJAFAR:  You\\'re speechless, I see.  A fine quality in a\\n        wife.\\nJASMINE:    I will never marry you.  (She goes to the SULTAN)\\n        Father, I choose Prince Ali!\\nJAFAR:  Prince Ali left!\\n\\n(A quick pan finds ALADDIN standing in the doorway to the balcony.)\\n\\nALADDIN:    Better check your crystal ball  again, Jafar!\\nJASMINE:    Prince Ali!\\n\\n(JAFAR gasps at the sight of ALADDIN.)\\n\\nIAGO:       How in the he--(back to parrot-ese)--uh, awk!\\nALADDIN:    Tell them the truth, Jafar!  You tried to have me\\n        killed.\\nJAFAR:  What?  (He goes to the SULTAN)  Ridiculous\\n        nonsense, your highness.  He is obviously lying.\\n        (He brings the staff close to the SULTAN\\'s face.)\\nSULTAN: Obviously...lying.\\n\\n(ALADDIN sees the staff with its glowing eyes.)\\n\\nJASMINE:    Father, what\\'s wrong with you?\\nALADDIN:    I know!\\n\\n(ALADDIN grabs the staff and smashes it on the floor. JAFAR flinches\\n    and the spell is broken for good.)\\n\\nSULTAN: Oh, oh, oh my!\\nALADDIN:    Your highness, Jafar\\'s been controlling you with\\n        this!  (He advances the staff)\\nSULTAN: What?  Jafar?  You, you traitor!\\n\\n(The trio advances on JAFAR.)\\n\\nJAFAR:  Your majesty, all of this can be explained.\\nSULTAN: Guards! Guards!\\nIAGO:       Well, that\\'s it--we\\'re dead, forget about it.  Just\\n        dig a grave for both of us.  We\\'re dead.\\n\\n(But JAFAR sees the lamp in ALADDIN\\'s pocket.  He makes a move, but\\n    is grabbed by guards.)\\n\\nSULTAN: Arrest Jafar at once.\\nJAFAR:  This is not done yet, boy!\\n\\n(JAFAR pulls a vial from his pocket.  ALADDIN sees this and rushes\\n    him, but JAFAR throws the vial to the floor.  A large red cloud\\n    appears.  When it is gone, so is JAFAR.)\\n\\nSULTAN: Find him, search everywhere!\\nALADDIN:    Jasmine, are you all right?\\nJASMINE:    Yes.\\n\\n(They lean in to kiss, but the SULTAN barges between them.)\\n\\nSULTAN: Jafar, my most trusted counselor, plotting against\\n        me all this time.  Just horrible.  How will I ever-\\n        (He stops in mid sentence and looks at the pair.)\\n        Can it be true?  My daughter has finally chosen a\\n        suitor? (She nods) Ha ha!  Praise Allah!  You\\n        brilliant boy, I could kiss you!   I won\\'t--I\\'ll\\n        leave that to my--.  You two will be wed at once!\\n        Yes, yes.  And you\\'ll be happy and prosperous, and\\n        then my boy, you will be sultan!\\nALADDIN:    Sultan?\\nSULTAN: Yes, a fine upstanding youth like yourself, a\\n        person of your unimpeachable moral character is\\n        exactly what this kingdom needs!  (ALADDIN looks\\n        concerned at this.)\\n\\n(Cut to int. of JAFAR\\'s chambers.  JAFAR and IAGO enter.)\\n\\nIAGO:       We gotta get outta here!  We gotta get--  I gotta\\n        start packing, your highness.  Only essentials.\\n        (IAGO starts throwing things out of his cage.\\n        JAFAR smiles broadly.)  Travel light! Bring the\\n        guns, the weapons, the knives (Stops and takes out\\n        a picture of himself    and JAFAR) and how about\\n        this picture?  I don\\'t know--I think I\\'m making a\\n        weird face in it. (JAFAR starts to laugh wildly.)\\n        Oh, boy--he\\'s gone nuts.  He\\'s cracked.  (IAGO\\n        flies down to him and knocks on his head.)  Jafar?\\n        Jafar?  Get a grip, Jafar! (JAFAR grabs him around\\n        the neck) Good grip!\\nJAFAR:  Prince Ali is nothing more than that ragged urchin\\n        Aladdin.  He has the lamp, Iago.\\nIAGO:       Why that miserable--\\nJAFAR:  But you are going to relieve him of it!\\nIAGO:       Me?\\n\\n(Cut to ext. of palace.  ALADDIN is looking at the gardens.)\\n\\nALADDIN:    Sultan?  They want me to be sultan?\\n\\n(GENIE comes out of lamp)\\n\\nGENIE:  Huzzah!  Hail the conquering hero!  (Turns into a\\n        one-man band.  He sees ALADDIN walk away with his\\n        head hung.  He stops, scratches his head, comes up\\n        with an idea, then zooms over to ALADDIN.  He holds\\n        up his hands like a director scoping a picture and\\n        we look through them.)  Aladdin, you\\'ve just won\\n        the heart of the princess.  What are you gonna do\\n        next?  (ALADDIN looks at him, then walks away in\\n        sadness to the bed, where he falls on it and sighs.\\n        GENIE again is confused, then goes to him and pulls\\n        out a script labeled \"Aladdin.\" Whispering: )\\n        Psst, your line is \"I\\'m going to free the genie.\"\\n        Anytime.\\nALADDIN:    Genie...I can\\'t.\\nGENIE:  Sure you can.  You just go \"Genie, I wish you\\n        free.\"  (He grabs ALADDIN\\'s head and uses\\n        him as a mock ventriloquist\\'s dummy.  ALADDIN pulls away.)\\nALADDIN:    I\\'m serious.  Look, I\\'m sorry--I really am. But\\n        they want to make me sultan--no!, They want to make\\n        Prince Ali sultan.  Without you, I\\'m just Aladdin.\\nGENIE:  Al, you won!\\nALADDIN:    Because of you!  The only reason anyone thinks I\\'m\\n        anything is because of you.  What if they find out\\n        I\\'m not really a prince?  (Quietly)  What if\\n        Jasmine finds out?  I\\'ll lose her.  Genie, I can\\'t\\n        keep this up on my own.  I can\\'t wish you free.\\nGENIE:  (Sarcastically) Hey, I understand.  After all,\\n        you\\'ve lied to everyone else.  Hey, I was beginning\\n        to feel left out.  Now, if you\\'ll excuse me,\\n        master. (He says the last word in disgust, then\\n        poofs back into the lamp.)\\n\\n(ABU and CARPET are watching from the window.)\\n\\nABU:        Ohhh.\\nALADDIN:    Genie, I\\'m really sorry. (A tongue comes out of the\\n        spout and raspberries him.)   Well, fine. (He slams\\n        a pillow on top of the LAMP.)  Then just stay in\\n        there!  (He looks at ABU and CARPET.)  What are you\\n        guys looking at? (They both leave.) Look, I--I\\'m\\n        sorry.  Wait, Abu-- wait--I\\'m sorry, I didn\\'t--\\n        wait, c\\'mon.  (He sighs.)  What am I doing?\\n        Genie\\'s right--I gotta tell Jasmine the truth.\\nJASMINE:    (From a distance)  Ali, oh Ali--will you come here?\\nALADDIN:    (Putting on his turban) Well, here goes.  (He walks\\n        into the garden.)  Jasmine?  Where are you?\\n\\n(We see IAGO wearing a beak and standing on stilts next to a FLAMINGO\\n    in the pond.  He is imitating JASMINE\\'s voice.)\\n\\nIAGO:       Ahem--In the menagerie, hurry.\\nALADDIN:    I\\'m coming.\\n\\n(We see ALADDIN hurry past, not noticing the birds.  IAGO laughs,\\n    then turns back and looks into the face of a FLAMINGO, who is\\n    panting.)\\n\\nFLAMINGO:   D\\'uh!\\nIAGO:       Ya got a problem, pinky?  (He sweeps the bird\\'s\\n        feet out from under it. IAGO runs into the palace\\n        and finds the lamp under the pillow.)  Boy, Jafar\\'s\\n        gonna be happy to see you!  (Stretches his face\\n        like JAFAR\\'s and imitates it.)  Good work, Iago!\\n        (Normal) Ah, go on.  (JAFAR) No, really--on a scale\\n        of one to ten, you are an eleven! (Normal) Ah,\\n        Jafar--you\\'re too kind.  I\\'m embarrassed, I\\'m\\n        blushing.  (He flies away with the lamp.)\\n\\n(Cut to the palace entrance.  The SULTAN is standing on top, making\\n    an announcement to the people.)\\n\\nSULTAN: People of Agrabah, My daughter has finally chosen a\\n        suitor!\\n\\n(Cut to behind the curtain, where JASMINE is peeking.  ALADDIN\\n    appears at the bottom of the stairs.)\\n\\nALADDIN:    Jasmine?\\nJASMINE:    Ali, where have you been?\\nALADDIN:    There\\'s something I\\'ve got to tell you.\\nJASMINE:    The whole kingdom has turned out for father\\'s\\n        announcement!\\nALADDIN:    No! But Jasmine, listen to me, please!\\nJASMINE:    Good luck!  (She pushes him out onto the platform\\n        with the SULTAN, where he overlooks the entire\\n        crowd.)\\nSULTAN: ...Ali Ababwa!\\nALADDIN:    Oh, boy!\\n\\n(Far above, IAGO and JAFAR watch through a window.)\\n\\nIAGO:   Look at them, cheering that little pipsqueak.\\nJAFAR:  Let them cheer.\\n\\n (He lifts the lamp and rubs it.  GENIE comes out.)\\n\\nGENIE:  You know Al, I\\'m getting (turns and sees JAFAR)\\n        reallyyyyyy--I don\\'t think you\\'re him.  (He\\n        descends and consults a playbill.)  Tonight, the\\n        role of Al will be played by a tall, dark and\\n        sinister ugly man.\\nJAFAR:  I am your master now.  (He throws GENIE to the\\n        ground and puts his foot on GENIE\\'s face.)\\nGENIE:  I was afraid of that.\\nJAFAR:  Genie, grant me my first wish.  I wish to rule on\\n        high, as sultan!!!\\n\\n(Cut to ext where dark clouds circle the castle.  The castle shakes.\\n    The roof rips off and the SULTAN and ALADDIN duck.)\\n\\nALADDIN:    Whoa!\\nSULTAN: Bless my soul.  What is this?  What is going on?\\n\\n(His turban lifts off his head.  When he grabs it, his whole body\\n    flies up, then is stripped of all his clothing except his boxer\\n     shorts.  The clothing reappears on JAFAR.)\\n\\nJAFAR:  Heh heh heh!\\nSULTAN: Jafar, you vile betrayer.\\nIAGO:       That\\'s Sultan Vile Betrayer to you.\\nALADDIN:    Oh, yeah?  Well, we\\'ll just see about that!  (Pulls\\n        off his own turban, but finds it empty)  The lamp!\\nJAFAR:  Finders-keepers, Abooboo.\\n\\n(They both look up and see a gigantic GENIE lift the palace into\\n    the clouds..  ALADDIN whistles and CARPET flies up to greet him.\\n      They fly up near the GENIE\\'s head.)\\n\\nALADDIN:    Genie!  No!\\nGENIE:  Sorry, kid--I got a new master now.  (He places the\\n        palace on top of a mountain.)\\nSULTAN: Jafar, I order you to stop!\\nJAFAR:  There\\'s a new order now--my order!  Finally, you\\n        will bow to me!\\n\\n(The SULTAN bows, but JASMINE does not.)\\n\\nJAFAR:  We\\'ll never bow to you!\\nIAGO:       Why am I not surprised?\\nJAFAR:  If you will not bow before a sultan, then you will\\n        cower before a sorcerer!  (To GENIE)  Genie, my\\n        second wish--I wish to be the most powerful\\n        sorcerer in the world!\\n\\n(GENIE extends his finger.  ALADDIN tries to stop him, but he cannot,\\n    and another GENIE (tm) brand lightning bolt  strikes JAFAR,\\n     returning him to his normal look.)\\n\\nIAGO:       Ladies and gentlemen, a warm Agrabah welcome for\\n        Sorcerer Jafar!\\nJAFAR:  Now where were we?  Ah, yes--abject humiliation!\\n        (He zaps JASMINE and the SULTAN with his staff, and\\n        they both bow to him. RAJAH comes running at him.\\n        He zaps RAJAH, and the tiger turns into a kitty-\\n        cat.)  Down, boy!  Oh, princess--(lifts her chin\\n        with his staff)--there\\'s someone I\\'m dying to\\n        introduce you to.\\nALADDIN:    (off-camera) Jafar!  Get your hands off her!\\n\\n(JAFAR zaps ALADDIN.  CARPET flies away.)\\n\\nJAFAR:  Prince Ali\\n    Yes, it is he,\\n    But not as you know him.\\n    Read my lips and come to grips\\n    With reality\\n\\n(JAFAR brings the two of them closer in the air.)\\n\\n    Yes, meet a blast from your past\\n    Whose lies were too good to last\\n    Say hello to your precious Prince Ali!\\n\\n(JAFAR zaps ALI back to ALADDIN.)\\n\\nIAGO:       Or should we say Aladdin?\\nALADDIN:    Jasmine, I tried to tell you.\\n\\nJAFAR:  So Ali turns out to be merely Aladdin\\n    Just a con, need I go on?\\n    Take it from me\\n    His personality flaws\\n    Give me adequate cause\\n    To send him packing on a one-way trip\\n    So his prospects take a terminal dip\\n    His assets frozen, the venue chosen\\n    Is the ends of the earth, whoopee!\\n    So long,\\nIAGO:       Good bye, see ya!\\nJAFAR:  Ex-Prince Ali!\\n\\n(JAFAR has zapped ABU back to normal.  He sends the two of them into\\n    a tall pillar, then launches it like a rocket, but not before\\n    CARPET can get in.  F2B, then we see a snowy wasteland, where\\n    the pillar crashes and rolls.  It finally comes to a stop.\\n    ALADDIN emerges, obviously very cold.)\\n\\nALADDIN:    Abu?  Abu!  (He looks back at a shivering pile of\\n        snow.)  Oh, this is all my fault--I should have\\n        freed the genie when I had the chance.  (He digs\\n        out ABU and cradles him inside his vest.)  Abu!\\n        Are you okay?  I\\'m sorry, Abu--I made a mess of\\n        everything, somehow.  I gotta go back and set\\n        things right.  (He starts to walk through the snow,\\n        and he eventuallysteps on a frozen CARPET.)\\n        Carpet!  (He looks up and sees CARPET is pinned by\\n        the pillar.  He tugs to try and free CARPET.  He\\n        can\\'t do it, so he begins to remove snow from the\\n        base of the pillar.)   Abu, start digging!  That\\'s\\n        it!  (Finally, enough snow has been removed, and\\n        the pillar begins to roll.  ALADDIN runs away,\\n        looks back, then slides into place.  The pillar\\n        rolls over him, and when it is gone, ALADDIN and\\n        ABU are left sitting in the patch of snow made by\\n        the window of the pillar.)  Yeah!  All right!  (He\\n        looks up at his turban, made out of scared ABU.\\n        CARPET shakes off the snow and rushes over to pick\\n        them up.)  Now, back to Agrabah!  Let\\'s go!\\n\\n(We cut back to ext. long shot of Agrabah, shrouded in red clouds.\\n    Cut to int. and slow zoom of throne room. IAGO has the SULTAN\\n    tied up like a marionette, and JASMINE is chained next to the\\n    throne.)\\n\\nIAGO:       Puppet ruler want a cracker? Here\\'s your cracker.\\n        Shove \\'em all right down your throat.  Here, have\\n        lots!\\n\\n(JAFAR pulls the chain, and JASMINE walks up to him holding an apple.)\\n\\nJAFAR:  Leave him alone!\\n\\n(IAGO stops for a second, then continues.)\\n\\nJAFAR:  It pains me to see you reduced to this, Jasmine.\\n        (He takes a bite out of the apple she is holding.)\\n        A beautiful desert bloom such as yourself should be\\n        on the arm of the most powerful man in the world.\\n        (He waves his finger and a crown appears.) What do\\n        you say, my dear?  Why,  with you as my queen...\\n\\n(She picks up a glass of wine and throws it in his face.)\\n\\nJASMINE:    Never!\\nJAFAR:  I\\'ll teach you some respect! (She falls back as he\\n        raises his hand to slap her.  Then he stops.)  No.\\n        Genie, I have decided to make my final wish.  I\\n        wish for Princess Jasmine to fall desperately in\\n        love with me.\\n\\n(We see ALADDIN race back into town.)\\n\\nGENIE:  (Again as Buckley) Ah, master-- there are a few\\n        addendas, some quid pro quo-\\nJAFAR:  Don\\'t talk back to me, you stupid blue lout!  You\\n        will do what I order you to do, slave!\\n\\n(JASMINE looks up and sees ALADDIN in the window, motioning her to\\n    play along.)\\n\\nJASMINE:    (She stands and puts the crown on her head.)\\n        Jafar!  I never realized how incredibly\\n        handsome you are.\\n\\n(The GENIE\\'s jaw drops.)\\n\\nJAFAR:  That\\'s better.  (He pulls the GENIE\\'s jaw up like a\\n        shade.)  Now, pussycat, tell me more\\n        about...myself.\\nJASMINE:    You\\'re tall, well dressed...\\n\\n(JAFAR walks over to her.  ALADDIN jumps down with ABU and GENIE\\n    sees them.)\\n\\nGENIE:  Al!  Al, little buddy!\\nALADDIN:    Shh!\\nGENIE:  (Literally zips his mouth shut, then unzips it.)\\n        Al, I can\\'t help you--I work for senor psychopath,\\n        now.  (His head turns into JAFAR\\'s, then back.)\\nALADDIN:    Hey--I\\'m a street rat, remember? (He rezips GENIE\\'s\\n        mouth.)  I\\'ll improvise.\\n\\n(He slides down a pile of coins and hides close to JAFAR and JASMINE.\\n    JAFAR\\'s back is to ALADDIN.)\\n\\nJAFAR:  Go on.\\nJASMINE:    And your beard...is so...twisted!  (She has her\\n        arms around him.  She pretends to twist with her\\n        finger, but she is actually motioning for ALADDIN\\n        to come over.  He makes his move.  IAGO sees him.)\\n\\nIAGO:       Jaf--mmmmmm! (ABU grabs him and covers his mouth.)\\nJAFAR:  And the street rat?\\nJASMINE:    What street rat?\\n\\n(They are about to kiss when IAGO manages to knock over a bowl.  JAFAR\\n    turns to look, but JASMINE grabs him back and kisses him.  ALADDIN\\n     looks disgusted.  IAGO and ABU both look disgusted.)\\n\\nABU:        Yuck!\\nJAFAR:  That was--(he sees ALADDIN\\'s reflection in her\\n        crown.) You!!  How many times do I have\\n        to kill you, boy?\\n\\n (He zaps ALADDIN.  JASMINE rushes him, and he throws her to the\\n    ground.  ALADDIN rushes and grabs the staff.)\\n\\nALADDIN:    Get the lamp!\\n\\n(JASMINE runs to it.  JAFAR, however, shakes off ALADDIN, then\\n    zaps her into an hourglass.)\\n\\nJAFAR:  Ah, ah, ah, princess--Your time is up!\\n\\n(Sand begins to fall from the top onto her.)\\n\\nALADDIN:    Jasmine!\\nIAGO:       Oh, nice shot, Jaf-- (he is knocked out by ABU.)\\n\\n(ABU rushes for the lamp.)\\n\\nJAFAR:  Don\\'t toy with me!  (He\\'s zapped into a toy monkey.\\nALADDIN:    Abu!\\n\\n\\n(CARPET rushes in.)\\n\\nJAFAR:  Things are unraveling fast, now boy. (CARPET is\\n        zapped and unravels.  ALADDIN again rushes for the\\n        lamp.)  Get the point?  (His path is blocked by\\n        large swords sticking in the floor.  JAFAR grabs\\n        the lamp and laughs hideously. ALADDIN pulls a\\n        sword out of the floor.) I\\'m just getting warmed\\n        up!  (He breathes a ring of fire around ALADDIN.)\\nALADDIN:    Are you afraid to fight me yourself, you cowardly\\n        snake?\\nJAFAR:  A snake, am I?  Perhaps you\\'d like to see how\\n        snake-like I can be!  (He smiles broadly, and we\\n        see a snake\\'s tongue come out from behind his\\n        teeth.  He then turns into a giant cobra, and the\\n        ring of fire around ALADDIN becomes part of the\\n        snake encircling ALADDIN.  The snake JAFAR makes\\n        moves on ALADDIN, and on the third try, ALADDIN\\n        swings the sword and hits JAFAR.  Cut to GENIE\\n        cheerleaders wearing \\'A\\' sweaters.)\\n\\nGENIE:  Rickem, rockem, rackem, rake--stick that sword into\\n        that snake!\\nJAFAR:  You stay out of thissss!\\n\\n(GENIE waving a tiny pennant with a \\'J\\' on it.)\\n\\nGENIE:  (Weakly) Jafar, Jafar, he\\'s our man--if he can\\'t do it,\\n        GREAT!\\n\\n(ALADDIN uses the distraction to make a break for the hourglass where\\n    JASMINE is trapped.  However, JAFAR sees this and blocks the path.\\n     ALADDIN is thrown away, and he loses his sword.)\\n\\nJASMINE:    Aladdin!\\n\\n(ALADDIN jumps on a large gem and slides across the floor, grabbing\\n    the sword on his way.  He turns a corner, but the pursuing snake\\n    cannot, and the front half of JAFAR crashes through a wall and\\n    hangs outside the palace.  ALADDIN jumps up on the snake\\'s back\\n     and stabs it.  JAFAR screams in agony.  ALADDIN again tries to\\n     free the princess.)\\n\\nALADDIN:    Hang on, Jasmine!\\n\\n(He is about to hit the glass with his sword when JAFAR grabs him.)\\n\\nJAFAR:  (laughs hideously)  You little fool!  You thought\\n        you could defeat the most powerful being on earth!\\nIAGO:       (with GENIE coming up behind him) Squeeze him,\\n        Jafar--Squeeze him like a--awk! (GENIE elbows him\\n        out of the way)\\nJAFAR:  Without the genie, boy, you\\'re nothing!\\nALADDIN:    (Has an idea)  The genie!  The genie!  The genie\\n        has more power than you\\'ll ever have!\\nJAFAR:  What!!\\nALADDIN:    He gave you your power, he can take it away!\\nGENIE:  Al, what are you doing?  Why are you bringing me\\n        into this?\\nALADDIN:    Face it, Jafar--you\\'re still just second best!\\nJAFAR:  You\\'re right!  His power does exceed my own!  But\\n        not for long!\\n\\n(JAFAR circles around the GENIE.)\\n\\nGENIE:  The boy is crazy.  He\\'s a little punch drunk.  One\\n        too many hits with the snake  (His hand\\n        turns into a snake and he hits his head with it.)\\nJAFAR:  Slave, I make my third wish!  I wish to be an all\\n        powerful genie!\\nGENIE:  (Reluctantly) All right, your wish is my command.\\n        Way to go, Al.\\n\\n(GENIE zaps JAFAR with the last GENIE (tm) brand lightning bolt.\\n    JAFAR\\'s snake form dissipates and he turns into a genie.  We\\n     see JASMINE\\'s raised hand disappear under the sand.  ALADDIN\\n    runs over and finally smashes the glass.  Sand and princess\\n     pour out.)\\n\\nJAFAR:  Yes!  Yes!  The power! The absolute power!\\nJASMINE:    (to ALADDIN) What have you done?\\nALADDIN:    Trust me!\\n\\n(A black lamp appears at JAFAR\\'s base.  JAFAR is busy conjuring.)\\n\\nJAFAR:  The universe is mine to command, to control!\\nALADDIN:    Not so fast, Jafar!  Aren\\'t you forgetting something?\\n    (JAFAR looks down questioningly) You wanted to be a genie, you\\n    got it!  And everything that goes with it!\\n\\n(Shackles appear on JAFAR\\'s wrists.)\\n\\nJAFAR:  No!  No!\\nIAGO:       I\\'m gettin\\' out of here!  Come on, you\\'re the\\n        genie, I don\\'t want--\\n\\n(IAGO tries to fly away, but is sucked in with JAFAR.)\\n\\nALADDIN:    Phenomenal cosmic powers!  Itty bitty living space.\\nGENIE:  Al, you little genius, you!\\n\\n(ABU turns back to normal, the CARPET re-ravels, JASMINE, the SULTAN\\n    and RAJAH are standing together.  RAJAH jumps up into the arms of\\n     the SULTAN, then they are all transformed.  The SULTAN is crushed\\n     because of the weight of the new RAJAH.  The palace reappears\\n     where it used to be in the city.  ALADDIN is left holding the\\n    new lamp.)\\n\\nJAFAR:  (Both from inside the lamp.)  Get your blasted beak\\n        out of my face!\\nIAGO:       Oh, shut up, you moron!\\nJAFAR:  Don\\'t tell me to shut up!\\nGENIE:  Allow me.  (He takes the lamp and goes to the\\n        balcony.  He is now wearing a baseball cap.  He\\n        winds up as if to throw the lamp, but opens his\\n        palm flat and flicks it out into the desert\\n        with his finger.) Ten- thousand years in a cave of\\n        wonders ought to chill him out!\\n\\n(JAFAR and IAGO continue to argue as they fade out.  JASMINE walks\\n    over to ALADDIN.  They hold hands, but both look sad.)\\n\\nALADDIN:    Jasmine, I\\'m sorry I lied to you about being a\\n        prince.\\nJASMINE:    I know why you did.\\nALADDIN:    Well, I guess...this... is goodbye?  (GENIE pokes\\n        his head around the corner shocked at what he is\\n        hearing.)\\nJASMINE:    Oh, that stupid law.  This isn\\'t fair--I love you.\\nGENIE:  (Wipes away a tear)  Al, no problem. You\\'ve still\\n        got one wish left.  Just say the word and you\\'re a\\n        prince again.\\nALADDIN:    But Genie, what about your freedom?\\nGENIE:  Hey, it\\'s only an eternity of servitude.  This is\\n        love.  (He leans down next to her.)  Al, you\\'re\\n        not gonna find another girl like her in a million\\n        years.  Believe me, I know.  I\\'ve looked.\\nALADDIN:    Jasmine, I do love you, but I\\'ve got to stop\\n        pretending to be something I\\'m not.\\nJASMINE:    I understand.\\n\\n(They take one final look into each other\\'s eyes, then ALADDIN turns\\n    to the GENIE.)\\n\\nALADDIN:    Genie, I wish for your freedom.\\nGENIE:  One bona fide prince pedigree coming up.  I--what?\\nALADDIN:    (He holds the lamp up to GENIE.)  Genie, you\\'re\\n        free!\\n\\n(A transformation scene ensues, in which the shackles fall off\\n    GENIE\\'s wrist and the lamp falls uselessly to the ground.\\n     GENIE picks it up and looks at it.)\\n\\nGENIE:  (He can\\'t believe it.)  Heh, heh!  I\\'m free. I\\'m\\n        free.  (He hands the lamp to ALADDIN.)  Quick,\\n        quick, wish for something outrageous.  Say  \"I want\\n        the Nile.\"   Wish for the Nile.  Try that!\\nALADDIN:    I wish for the Nile.\\nGENIE:  No way!!  (Laughs hysterically.  He bounces around\\n        the balcony like a pinball.)  Oh does that feel\\n        good!  I\\'m free!  I\\'m free at last!  I\\'m hittin\\'\\n        the road.  I\\'m off to see the world!

No matter what anybody says, you\\'ll\\n        always be a prince to me.\\n\\n(They hug.  The SULTAN steps forward.)\\n\\nSULTAN: That\\'s right.  You\\'ve certainly proven your worth\\n        as far as I\\'m concerned. It\\'s that law that\\'s the\\n        problem.\\nJASMINE:    Father?\\nSULTAN: Well, am I sultan or am I sultan?  From this day\\n        forth, the princess shall marry whomever she deems\\n        worthy.\\nJASMINE:    (She smiles widely and runs into ALADDIN\\'s arms.)\\n        Him!

Hawk is sort of the brains of this operation, but \\n               knowing the others, that doesn\\'t say much.\\n\\n               LEX POUNDS a bass with earnest determination. Lanky with bad \\n               posture, Lex is already sporting worry lines. He takes \\n               everything way-too-seriously.\\n\\n               TRIP STRUMS lead guitar like he\\'s hammering nails. All id, \\n               Trip is slightly out of his mind. But, is it the chemicals \\n               or just his chemistry. He always wears a knit cap.\\n\\n               JAM, a sensitive kid (but no wuss), BASHES on his drums like \\n               a madman making the bass drum pulsate like a spastic heart. \\n               The big drum bears the word \"Mystery\" painted on its skin \\n               with a lightning \"S\" just like the KISS logo.\\n\\n               They bring the classic tune to a shrieking conclusion and \\n               thrust their hands over their heads in the KISS symbol.  \\n               Hawk screams into the mike at their imaginary audience.\\n\\n                                     HAWK\\n                         Thank you, Cleveland!

OTHER HALLWAY - DAY\\n\\n               Lex catches up with Hawk and Trip just as Elvis swings around \\n               the corner and marauds after them CACKLING maniacally. A mad \\n               chase ensues. Down hallways. Around corners. Upstairs.

Thinking fast, Hawk grabs it out of \\n               the nerd\\'s hands and pushes it down the hall at Elvis.\\n\\n                                     NERD\\n                         Hey, I\\'m responsible for that!\\n\\n               CRASH! Elvis bashes face-first into the rolling cart. He and \\n               the projector go tumbling. Not wasting a second, Elvis is \\n               back on his feet and after them again. The nerd grabs his \\n               hair in horror at the sight of the smashed projector.\\n\\n               AROUND A CORNER\\n\\n               Elvis SKIDS around the corner and trips on a fire hose \\n               stretched across the floor from its glass box to a water \\n               fountain pipe. He slides on his belly along the polished \\n               floor unable to stop.\\n\\n               INT. ENGLISH CLASS - DAY\\n\\n               Old MISS HIBBS is lecturing on MOBY DICK.

He clamors \\n               to his feet and shoots out the room leaving everyone stunned.\\n\\n               INT. HALLWAY - DAY\\n\\n               Pausing at the corner, Elvis takes a breath and leaps around \\n               it. He smiles at what he sees.\\n\\n               Up ahead, Hawk, Lex, and Trip stand on a 3-stair stoop, \\n               desperately pulling at a locked door. Elvis smiles.

Ketchup spatters \\n               across his body in SUPER SLOW MOTION. A shot hits him in the \\n               mouth and he COUGHS it back out in mid-scream.\\n\\n               The boys stomp relentlessly, mercilessly, blasting their \\n               nemesis with hideous cafeteria red as Elvis throws his arms \\n               back, body quaking at every splat. It\\'s kind of like the \\n               scene in \"The Godfather\" where Sonny gets it.\\n\\n               Beaten and spent, his scream now dried up to a hoarse GASPING, \\n               Elvis slips on some ketchup at his feet.

Taking Elvis\\'s key chain away, he \\n               hops back up and unlocks the door letting Trip and Lex out. \\n               Hawk whips the keys back at Elvis, hitting him in the head, \\n               then flashes a pearly Error Flynn smile.\\n\\n                                     HAWK\\n                         Elvis, you ain\\'t nothin\\' but a hot \\n                         dog.\\n\\n               Hawk bolts out the door.

Kenny and Bobby climb from their car and storm \\n               over to the boys.\\n\\n               Hawk opens his door just as Kenny\\'s hairy-knuckled hands \\n               pull him out through the window.

Bobby opens the back door and does the same with \\n               Lex and Jam.\\n\\n               With a kid in each hand now, Kenny and Bobby SLAM the four \\n               boys against the Volvo in a line. The size difference between \\n               the burnouts and the guidos is painfully obvious now.

SMILEY MART - NIGHT\\n\\n               The store is crawling with KISS FANS, some reading the comic \\n               books, others playing pinball against a far wall, still others \\n               looking at the poster section. Trip enters on a mission.\\n\\n               He looks around catching the eye of a pretty CASHIER. She\\'s \\n               a rocker, wearing a Who tee-shirt, a mood ring, and just a \\n               little too much make-up. She smiles at him. Trip returns the \\n               smile with a feeble wave. Her mood ring turns from blue to \\n               pink.\\n\\n               Concentrating on the layout of the store, Trip peers all the \\n               way to the back to a darkened corner... where he spies a \\n               LITTLE KID wearing a KISS tee-shirt playing a KISS pinball \\n               machine.\\n\\n               Trip smiles. The eagle has spotted a fuzzy, little bunny. He \\n               moves in for the kill, walking past a crowd of kids at the \\n               magazine rack, past the Hostess aisle, past the dairy cooler \\n               and into the darkened corner.\\n\\n               He stands behind the little kid, relishing this moment. The \\n               kid is actually pretty good. We also see now the little kid \\n               has his face painted like Ace Frehley.\\n\\n                                     TRIP\\n                         Hey, little kid.\\n\\n               Suddenly distracted, the kid loses the ball.\\n\\n                                     LITTLE KID\\n                         Shit!

While the kid thinks, Trip looks \\n               nervously up at Chongo and his buds. Chongo reaches into his \\n               denim vest pocket and we hear a CRINKLING NOISE. He comes \\n               back up with two walnuts, putting them between his bicep and \\n               forearm.\\n\\n               Trip watches in horror as Chongo makes a muscle and the \\n               walnuts are shelled between two walls of iron-hard flesh. \\n               CREEEAAAACK!

PARKING LOT - NIGHT\\n\\n               The full-to-capacity parking lot is patrolled by a couple of \\n               SECURITY GUARDS.\\n\\n               Lex cautiously makes his way to the edge of the parking lot \\n               and looks at the back side of Cobo Hall just beyond the chain \\n               link fence that surrounds the lot.\\n\\n               He crouches down and walks between two cars parked against \\n               the fence, looking both ways.

She immediately takes them out and stuffs \\n               them into her jacket. Jam doesn\\'t even move.\\n\\n                                     MRS. BRUCE\\n                         It\\'s about time you gave up on that \\n                         stupid dream once and for all.

CONFESSIONAL BOOTH - NIGHT\\n\\n               Jam kneels on the board and a mere two feet behind him, Beth \\n               sits on a bench shrouded in darkness. Her posture is that of \\n               someone with a crate of nitroglycerine on her lap.\\n\\n               We hear the SHUFFLING noise of the priest getting into his \\n               own compartment next door. A moment later the small, eye-\\n               level door SLIDES open. The priest\\'s face is barely visible \\n               on the other side of the thick screen, but he\\'s there.\\n\\n                                     JAM\\n                         Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned. \\n                         This is my first confession in... \\n                         well... a really long time.\\n\\n                                     PRIEST\\n                         Prepare to receive the Act of Penance.  \\n                         How many sins have you committed \\n                         since your last confession?\\n\\n                                     JAM\\n                         Just one, Father, but boy was it a \\n                         doozy.\\n\\n               Beth leans forward slightly and listens to Jam\\'s confession.\\n\\n               INT. IT\\'S RAINING MEN STRIP JOINT - NIGHT\\n\\n               Hawk\\'s at a bar stool gulping sloppily and woozily from a \\n               rocks glass. Four more empty rocks glasses sit in front of \\n               him. He stares at the sexy woman who smiles back, blowing \\n               him kisses from the other side of the bar.\\n\\n               The EMCEE enters the stage.\\n\\n                                     EMCEE\\n                              (into microphone)\\n                         Okay, ladies, hang onto your hormones. \\n                         Here comes our next amateur.

There\\'s nothing more sobering than having \\n               to undress in public.\\n\\n                                     HAWK\\n                         Oh, Dicky, I c-c-can\\'t...\\n\\n                                     BARTENDER\\n                         You\\'re not gonna chicken out on me \\n                         now, are you? We\\'ve got your KISS \\n                         song playing and everything.\\n\\n                                     HAWK\\n                         I-I c-can\\'t...\\n\\n                                     BARTENDER\\n                              (leans in close)\\n                         Look, people undress in public \\n                         because, A, they\\'re exhibitionists, \\n                         B, they\\'re nutcases, or C, they need \\n                         the money. I can tell you\\'re not A, \\n                         and I hope to hell you\\'re not B. So \\n                         my suggestion is, think about why \\n                         you\\'re a C and let your body party, \\n                         shake your groove thing, boogie oogie \\n                         oogie till you just can\\'t boogie no \\n                         more.\\n\\n               Hawk thinks about it, then downs the rest of his drink. He \\n               grimaces at it\\'s taste, then opens his eyes with new resolve.\\n\\n                                     HAWK\\n                         You\\'re right, Dicky. I gotta do it \\n                         for KISS. Gotta put a bag over its \\n                         head and \\n                              (hiccup)\\n                         Do it for KISS.\\n\\n               Hawk swivels his bar stool to the right and gets off, \\n               forgetting to stand when his feet hit the floor. He proceeds \\n               to fall flat on his face. Dicky looks down concerned, but \\n               Hawk stands with a little difficulty and heads for the stage. \\n               The crowd of women parts down the middle for him and checks \\n               him out as he walks by. They seem to like what they see. \\n               Hawk looks nervously at the carnivorous faces leering at his \\n               package first, his ass after. What the hell is he doing?\\n\\n               Hawk reluctantly climbs onto the stage and the gals start \\n               CLAPPING to the song. He faces them and starts gyrating his \\n               drunken hips at them, feeling no confidence whatsoever, \\n               until...\\n\\n               The CHEERS start to ECHO and the pulsing lights begin to \\n               hurt his eyes. Hawk watches the world proceed to spin faster \\n               than the disco ball above his head.\\n\\n               He stops gyrating and clutches his stomach. BELCHING. Uh-oh.\\n\\n               Hawk spots an almost-empty beer pitcher one of the CHEERING-\\n               IN-SLOW-MOTION women holds above her head. He runs up to the \\n               edge of the stage, grabs the pitcher, and PUKES.\\n\\n               The cheering and music come to a grinding halt. You can hear \\n               a pin drop as Hawk yacks his guts out into the beer pitcher. \\n               It goes on for an excruciatingly long time, then finally \\n               stops.\\n\\n               Hawk looks up at the hundreds of astonished eyes staring at \\n               him. He wipes his mouth, then a look of ease washes over his \\n               face.\\n\\n                                     HAWK\\n                         Wow. I feel a hundred times better!\\n\\n               He hands the vomit-filled pitcher back to the shocked woman.\\n\\n                                     HAWK\\n                         Thanks lady.\\n\\n               He looks over at the emcee, who gazes at Hawk from the DJ \\n               booth.\\n\\n                                     HAWK\\n                         Maestro? As you were.\\n\\n               The emcee stands perfectly still, jaw agape.\\n\\n                                     HAWK\\n                         Come on, dude, we got a bunch of \\n                         frisky felines waiting for some \\n                         entertainment! The show must go on!\\n\\n               Hawk starts gyrating even though the music is still off. The \\n               emcee shrugs, re-cuing the song. It starts again as Hawk \\n               faces the crowd, dancing with new-found bravado.\\n\\n               The women come out of their dumbstruck comas and reluctantly \\n               start CLAPPING again.\\n\\n               Hawk pulls off his jacket and twirls it over his head Roger \\n               Daltry style. Then he pulls it back down and tosses it into \\n               the crowd. The women actually fight over it.\\n\\n               Encouraged, Hawk then peels off his KISS Army tee-shirt and \\n               hurls it at the women, who SQUEAL with delight. Sure, he may \\n               be scrawny, but they don\\'t mind. This lad\\'s got personality.\\n\\n               Adrenaline pumping, confidence building, Hawk starts playing \\n               the crowd of very responsive ladies.\\n\\n               He unbuttons his jeans first. Then, leaving them on, he does \\n               an \"air guitar\" medley: Chuck Berry, ZZ Top, Angus Young \\n               from AC/DC, and Elvis Costello in six easy steps.\\n\\n               Hawk finishes off with a Pete Townshend windmill, shaking \\n               his ass at his audience in mid-strum, then licks his finger \\n               and touches one of his cheeks: \"hot stuff\" (he does this in \\n               a manly way of course).\\n\\n               Then Hawk pauses to adjust what looks to be his underwear \\n               bunching up in his crack.\\n\\n               The women WHOO-HOO.\\n\\n               He segues into a Mick Jagger rooster strut and the ladies go \\n               ga-ga. He makes the sign of the horns with each hand and \\n               wiggles a protruding tongue like Gene Simmons. The gals scream \\n               in orgastic joy.\\n\\n               Then, Hawk goes for the gold. Yes, he does the Fonzie dance! \\n               The women are now overcome by sheer animal lust. Hawk\\'s \\n               whipped his audience into a frenzied pack of bitches in heat. \\n               Amanda smirks and sucks from her little drink straw \\n               suggestively.\\n\\n               At long last Hawk figures he has to give them what they want.\\n\\n               He puts his fingers to his fly, pauses, then unzips. His \\n               Brittanias fall to his ankles, revealing a pair of bony legs \\n               sticking down from some KISS boxer shorts. The ladies go \\n               batty.\\n\\n               Unfortunately Hawk has neglected a cardinal rule of disrobing. \\n               Never pull your pants down without taking your shoes off \\n               first. He tries to kick off his shoes. The left one goes \\n               flying across the bar and THWACK, beans a MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN \\n               in the face. She flies backwards over a chair.\\n\\n               Trying to kick the other shoe off, Hawk loses his balance \\n               and falls backwards, hitting his head on the edge of the \\n               bar.\\n\\n                                 DRUM ROLL / NEGOTIATION\\n\\n               INT.

Jam is pushed like \\n               a twig in a flood and over the shoulders of those in front \\n               of him. Purely by accident, he is thrown onto the stage \\n               landing on his stomach between Paul and Gene. Just before \\n               Peter\\'s drum solo is about to start.\\n\\n               Gene, Paul, and Ace silence their instruments. Peter throws \\n               his drumstick into the air intending to catch it when it \\n               comes down. But the sight of Jam landing on the stage \\n               distracts him.\\n\\n               All is mute as Peter misses the drumstick. It hits the outside \\n               edge of one of the drums.\\n\\n               Thinking fast, Jam grabs one of his drumsticks out of his \\n               sock and tosses it to Peter. It tumbles through the air in \\n               SLOW MOTION with a LOW, WHOOPING, HELICOPTER SOUND. We see \\n               the word \"Mystery\" clearly as it twirls.\\n\\n               Instantly, it\\'s caught in Peter Criss\\'s hand and he brings \\n               it down on his drum not missing a beat. The song resumes \\n               with all its fury as Peter\\'s drum kit ascends on a hydraulic \\n               platform.\\n\\n               Jam scrambles from the stage and leaps back into the audience \\n               barely missing the claws of some security guards.\\n\\n               The four friends pound on each other with unbridled, teenage \\n               exuberance.

The sky is a glorious explosion of blue and\\nmauve and lavender. The setting sun washes the clouds with a delicate\\npink tint. The bird swoops and spirals and we are right there with\\nhim. Then suddenly, below us, an extraordinary sight appears.\\n\\n2\\tEXT: LABYRINTH - DAY\\n\\nIt is the labyrinth, an enormous maze of incredible mandala like\\nintricacy. From our magnificent vantage point, WE ARE BARELY ABLE TO\\nMAKE OUT its details: the twisting walls interrupted here and there\\nby lush forest, the complex web of waterways, the forbidding castle\\nat the core. It is vast and magical, frightening and compelling at\\nthe same time. We would love to linger, perhaps fly lower and get a\\nbetter look at this wondrous place, but the bird flies on\\n\\n3\\tEXT: GLADE - DAY\\n\\nIt is an idyllic setting, warm and inviting. The late afternoon sun\\nwashes everything with a pink glow. Between the water and a line of\\nlush fruit trees is a flower-strewn glade. A FIGURE emerges from the\\ntrees and walks toward the water. It is a YOUNG WOMAN dressed in a\\nflowing white dress that swirls around her in the breeze. The pink\\nlight burnishes her hair and causes a gold circlet she wears on her\\nhead to glow. She is breathtaking, a vision of innocence and grace.\\nShe stops to pick a flower and then turns suddenly as if she has\\nheard something.\\n\\nGIRL: Is it you?\\n\\nShe takes a few hurried steps and then stops, smiling shyly\\n\\nGIRL: Your Highness!\\n\\nThe GIRL curtsies deeply and then looks up through lowered lashes,\\nthe shy smile still dancing on her lips. And then WE PULL BACK TO\\nREVEAL a crown perched on a head of tight curls. WE ARE LOOKING\\nTHROUGH the crown at the girl as she rises slowly, then looks boldly\\nat the PRINCE.\\n\\nGIRL: Do not be swayed by my pleasure at the sight of you, my lord.\\nFor though my father, the Duke, has promised you my hand, I cannot\\nconsent to be yours until the evil that stalks our land from highest\\nhill to deepest dale is ...\\n\\nSuddenly the GIRL stops speaking, a look of stunned confusion on her\\nface.\\n\\nGIRL: ... from highest hill to deepest dale ... (her brow furrows in\\nconcentration and then) Damn!\\n\\nShe burrows one hand into the deep sleeve of her gown and pulls out a\\nrolled-up soft-cover book. She rifles through the pages.\\n\\nThe PRINCE is not a prince at all, but a SHEEPDOG wearing a tin foil\\ncrown. He thinks his work is over and it\\'s time to play and he lunges\\nhappily towards the GIRL who isn\\'t a princess or even a duchess, but\\n15-year-old SARAH.\\n\\nSARAH is knocked over by the playful DOG. Beneath the gown which WE\\nCAN NOW SEE is homemade and not very grand at all, WE SEE faded jeans\\nand running shoes.\\n\\nSARAH: Get off me, you monster!!\\n\\nThe DOG grabs the book out of her hand and runs away with it, hoping\\nto be chased. SARAH doesn\\'t follow, she just sits up and pulls the\\ngrass out of her tangled hair and sighs with frustration. The DOG\\ncomes back over to SARAH, its tail wagging hopefully.\\n\\nSARAH: If you value your mangy life, Merlin, you\\'ll hand it over.\\n\\nThe DOG obediently drops the book.\\n\\nTHE BOOK\\n\\nOn the cover it says, _MEANDER\\'S QUEEN a play in three acts by Robin\\nZakar_. SARAH reaches for it and we hear a clock tower begin to chime.\\n\\nSARAH leaps to her feet.\\n\\nSARAH: Oh no, Merlin! We\\'re really late! Why does everything have to\\nhappen to me!!!?\\n\\nMERLIN prances around her happily, his foil crown in his mouth. SARAH\\npulls it out of his mouth and throws it in a nearby trash basket. He\\nrushes after it and peers into the basket, wanting to fetch.\\n\\nSARAH: It\\'s all your fault, you miserable mutt!!\\n\\nShe hikes up her dress and runs into the trees. MERLIN whimpers and\\ntags along behind her.\\n\\n4\\tEXT: THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TREES - DAY\\n\\nSARAH comes bursting through the trees and runs down a hill toward\\nthe street. WE PULL BACK and WE CAN SEE an enormous steel mill on the\\nother side of the river. And now WE NOTICE that the light isn\\'t pink\\nany more but sort of dull and hazy, and the idyllic glade is barely a\\nsuburban park, and this is just an ordinary day in a very ordinary\\nplace.\\n\\n5\\tEXT: AN OLD RAMBLING HOUSE - DUSK\\n\\nSARAH runs up a path to an older, rambling house. She goes through\\nthe front door, MERLIN hot on her heels, and neither one of them sees\\nthe beautiful SNOW-WHITE BIRD that lands in a tree beside the path.\\n\\n6\\tINT: INSIDE THE ROUSE - EVENING\\n\\nSARAH bursts through the front door and makes a beeline for the\\nstairs. She almost makes it. SARAH\\'S MOTHER appears in the hallway.\\n\\nMOTHER: _Sarah_, where have you been?!!!\\n\\nSARAH abruptly stops and changes to an elegantly graceful ascension\\nof the stairs.\\n\\nSARAH (in an affected voice): I can\\'t talk to you now. I\\'m in\\nrehearsal.\\n\\nShe continues grandly on and heads for her room.\\n\\nMOTHER: You were supposed to be home an hour ago to baby-sit for\\nFreddie! Don\\'t we at least deserve an explanation?\\n\\nSARAH stops and leans over the railing. She speaks with a\\nmelodramatic solemnity.\\n\\nSARAH: As Meander\\'s Queen, I\\'ve been ... meandering. Dither me not\\nabout explanations.\\n\\nWith that she turns and heads for her room. On the door is a sign\\nthat says: \"Admittance by Invitation Only.\" SARAH\\'S FATHER comes into\\nthe hall.\\n\\nFATHER: What\\'s that all about?\\n\\nMOTHER: It\\'s a part in a play, (raising her voice) but that\\'s no\\nreason to...\\n\\nSARAH turns in her doorway. She calls down.\\n\\nSARAH: Chasten not your Queen, _Peasant_!\\n\\nShe dramatically sweeps into her room.\\n\\n7\\tINT: SARAH\\'S ROOM - NIGHT\\n\\nSARAH slams the door and leans against it, playing the scene.\\n\\nFATHER (VO): _Sarah_, that\\'s no way to talk to your mother!\\n\\nSARAH (mumbles to herself): She\\'s not my mother.\\n\\nSARAH takes a deep breath and closes her eyes. She can hear footsteps\\nand SOMEONE comes to the other side of the door.\\n\\nSARAH ignores her STEPMOTHER and kicks off her running shoes.\\n\\nWith a practiced gesture SARAH removes her jeans while leaving her\\ngown in place.\\n\\nSTEPMOTHER (VO): _Sarah_, when I tell you to be home at five, I\\nexpect you to be home at five.\\n\\nSARAH quickly shifts to her STEPMOTHER\\'s attitude -- hands on hips,\\nand silently mimes her words.\\n\\nSARAH: Yes, Madame!\\n\\n7A\\tINT: UPSTAIRS HALLWAY\\n\\nSTEPMOTHER: And don\\'t \"Yes Madame\" me!\\n\\nFATHER: Is she all right?\\n\\nSTEPMOTHER (frustrated): Of course she\\'s all right! I left the\\nBernsteins\\' number on the kitchen table ... Freddie might be coming\\ndown with a cold so call us if he seems even the least bit\\nuncomfortable ...\\n\\nSARAH (VO) (sighs): Yes, Mother.\\n\\nSTEPMOTHER: Oh! I give up!\\n\\nShe hurries down the stairs.\\n\\nFATHER: We\\'ll see you later, baby. And remember ...\\n\\n7B\\tINT: SARAH\\'S ROOM - NIGHT\\n\\nSARAH speaks along with him, mimicking.\\n\\nSARAH & FATHER (VO): Don\\'t open the door to strangers.\\n\\nWe hear him leave. SARAH waits a beat and then turns and opens her\\nbedroom door.\\n\\nSARAH: And don\\'t call me baby! (she slams the door shut; mimicking\\nher parents) Precious little Freddie might be coming down with a cold\\n...\\n\\nShe sighs and looks around. This is really her world, her retreat,\\nand she knows and controls every inch of it. The shelves are filled\\nwith an orderly array of childhood dolls and toys. The books are\\nlined up neatly in the bookcase and if we could see them up close we\\nwould see that they were placed in alphabetical order -- and\\naccording to the year they were acquired. She walks over to her\\ndresser. She checks herself out in the mirror above the chest of\\ndrawers and adjusts the golden circlet which has been knocked askew\\nby her run. She then stops for a moment and looks at the photographs\\non the dresser. One of her FATHER, her MOTHER and herself as a LITTLE\\nGIRL. Another picture of her MOTHER in a newspaper clipping is taped\\nto the mirror. The headline says, \"Linda Williams a Smash in New\\nPlay.\" A cover of a Playbill is also tacked on to the mirror. It says\\n_Best of Both Worlds_ starring Linda Williams. SARAH then reverently\\nopens a music box -- the kind with a twirling dancer inside -- and to\\nthe strains of an unbearably tinny version of \"Greensleeves\" she\\nbegins to rehearse.\\n\\nSARAH: Do not be swayed by my pleasure at the sight of you, my Lord\\n...\\n\\nSuddenly, something stops her cold.\\n\\nSARAH (yelling angrily): Someone has been in my room!\\n\\nThrough the mirror WE SEE what she sees: an empty space on one of the\\nshelves. She swirls around and rushes out the door.\\n\\n8\\tINT: THE HALLWAY - NIGHT\\n\\nSARAH bursts out of her room.\\n\\nSARAH: Where\\'s Lancelot?\\n\\nShe stomps down the hallway.\\n\\nSARAH: Where\\'s my bear?!!\\n\\n9\\tINT: NURSERY - NIGHT\\n\\nSARAH enters FREDDIE\\'s room. She searches the nursery.\\n\\nSARAH: Nobody listens to a thing I say.\\n\\nShe opens a toy box and rifles through it.\\n\\nSARAH: How many times have I told them to stay out of my room ...\\n\\nShe gets to the crib and looks down. FREDDIE is wide awake, gurgling\\nat Lancelot, SARAH\\'s tattered old teddy bear.\\n\\nSARAH: And you, you can just give me back my bear!\\n\\nShe yanks it out of the crib and leaves. FREDDIE looks hurt and his\\nface starts to cloud up.\\n\\n10\\tINT: SARAH \\'S ROOM - NIGHT\\n\\nSARAH is curled up on her bed, cuddling her bear. MERLIN sits beside\\nher. She looks at the DOG.\\n\\nSARAH: You\\'re the only one who understands me, Merlin.\\n\\nHe licks her face. She gets up and holds the bear out in front of her.\\n\\nSARAH: Do not be swayed by my pleasure at the sight of you, my lord\\n...\\n\\nShe is interrupted by FREDDIE\\'s cries.\\n\\nSARAH: Go to sleep, Freddie!\\n\\nThe cries get louder. SARAH sighs and repeats her favorite litany.\\n\\nSARAH: Why does everything have to happen to me?\\n\\n11\\tINT: NURSERY - NIGHT\\n\\nSARAH enters and approaches the howling INFANT.\\n\\nSARAH: I don\\'t need this.\\n\\nShe pulls the blanket up over him and attempts to tuck him in.\\n\\nSARAH: There, isn\\'t that nice ...\\n\\nBut FREDDIE doesn\\'t think so. He pushes the blanket off and howls\\neven louder. SARAH sees one of his toys on the floor and picks it up\\nand gives it to him. She speaks through gritted teeth.\\n\\nSARAH: Want your nice toy?\\n\\nBut FREDDIE doesn\\'t. He flings the toy across the room. SARAH bends\\nover the crib and speaks softly.\\n\\nSARAH: You know, Freddie, I heard that the only thing to do with a\\nbaby who won\\'t stop crying is to get some goblins to come over and\\nteach him a lesson ...\\n\\nFREDDIE lowers his screams to a whimper, but a loud whimper.\\n\\nSARAH: How would you like that, kid? A nasty evil goblin ...\\n\\nFREDDIE is quiet for a moment, almost as if he is considering. Then\\nhe really howls. SARAH sighs and picks him up. She begins to pace\\nback and forth, and starts to hum. FREDDIE goes back to a mere\\nwhimper.\\n\\nSARAH: Oh, you like that, do you?\\n\\nShe begins to hum even louder and more melodically as she places the\\nBABY back into the crib. She then begins one of the moat macabre\\nlullabies you could ever imagine. She sings of how scary the dark is,\\nhow \"the shadows on the wall like to eat you when you\\'re small\" and\\nhow \"a baby doesn\\'t stand a chance when the Goblins start their\\ndance.\" She throws herself into her performance; adding to it a wild\\ndance that has her whirling around the room, leaping into the air,\\nmaking strange shadows on the wall. Finally, the dance ends when too\\nmany crazed pirouettes result in her stumbling against FREDDIE\\'s\\ndresser. She staggers a bit and then the lights blink as a crack of\\nthunder is heard, followed by a flash of lightning.\\n\\nANOTHER ANGLE\\n\\nLittle FREDDIE is wailing. He hasn\\'t understood a thing that SARAH\\nhas sung but he can sense that something is wrong.\\n\\nSARAH: Ah, c\\'mon, Freddie. It was just a song.\\n\\nThey are interrupted by the sound of the doorbell. SARAH reacts with\\na gasp of surprise. FREDDIE, for some inexplicable reason, is\\nsuddenly quiet.\\n\\n12\\tINT: FOYER - NIGHT\\n\\nSARAH approaches the front door with some trepidation. She starts to\\nopen it, then realizes what she is doing. She fastens the chain and\\nonly then opens the door.\\n\\n13\\tEXT: HOUSE - NIGHT\\nSARAH\\'S POV\\n\\nThrough the door opening SARAH can see a very elegantly dressed,\\nquite good-looking MAN of an indeterminate age. He has a worldly air,\\nor is it other-worldly? Before he can speak a flash of lightning\\nilluminates his face. He is a mesmerizing sight and SARAH can\\'t help\\nbut gawk.\\n\\nMAN: Excuse me, is this the home of Sarah Williams ... Sarah\\nWilliams, the actress?\\n\\nSARAH\\'s jaw drops.\\n\\nSARAH: That\\'s me.\\n\\nMAN: Allow me to introduce myself ... (he holds out his hand) I\\'m\\nRobin Zaker.\\n\\nSARAH squeals with delight.\\n\\nSARAH: You wrote the play!\\n\\nHe smiles.\\n\\nSARAH: Just a second.\\n\\n14\\tINT: FOYER - NIGHT\\n\\nSARAH\\'s hand hesitates over the chain for just a moment, and then she\\nunfastens it and opens the door. ZAKAR enters and extends his hand.\\n\\nZAKAR: It is an honour, Miss Williams. I understand you make a\\ndelightful Queen Meander.\\n\\nSARAH: Well, we\\'ve just started rehearsal, but how did you know?\\n\\nZAKAR: I was passing through this part of the country and heard that\\nit was going to be done here. This is the first amateur production of\\nthe play, which of course is delightful for me.\\n\\nSARAH: You know we were supposed to open tonight, but we got delayed.\\nThe firemen had to use the hall.\\n\\nZAKAR: Yes, I know, that\\'s why I wanted to stop by to see you.\\n\\nThey are interrupted by a particularly loud crash from upstairs. And\\nthen FREDDIE begins to howl.\\n\\nSARAH: That\\'s my brother ...\\n\\nThere is another crash and SARAH starts up the stairs.\\n\\nSARAH: I\\'ll be right back!\\n\\nZAKAR watches her run up the stairs. He glances around and then walks\\nright to the liquor cabinet and takes out a bottle.\\n\\n15\\tINT: NURSERY - NIGHT\\n\\nFREDDIE in standing in his crib crying his eyes out. SARAH rushes in\\nand sees that the storm has blown open the basement window and it is\\ncrashing against the wall. She rushes to close it. FREDDIE\\'s screams\\nare piteous.\\n\\nSARAH: Oh, Freddie ...\\n\\nThere is more thunder, and then lightning flashes across the darkened\\nroom.\\n\\nZAKAR (VO): Perhaps I can soothe him ...\\n\\nSARAH gasps and whirls around. ZAKAR is framed in the doorway. He has\\na drink in his hand. SARAH holds the BABY close.\\n\\nSARAH: You shouldn\\'t be up here!\\n\\nZAKAR (smoothly): I just wanted to help ...\\n\\nSARAH rushes by him, still clutching the BABY.\\n\\n16\\tINT: HALLWAY - NIGHT\\n\\nSARAH comes out of the nursery and hurries down the stairs. ZAKAR\\nfollows. FREDDIE is still crying.\\n\\nSARAH: Maybe you\\'d better leave ...\\n\\nShe gets to the bottom of the stairs. FREDDIE whimpers. ZAKAR is\\nmaking her very nervous.\\n\\nSARAH: ... I, uh, don\\'t think I care to talk to you about the play.\\n\\nHe is right behind her, almost too close.\\n\\nZAKAR: Neither do I.\\n\\nSARAH is shocked and disturbed by this.\\n\\nSARAH: What!\\n\\nZAKAR reaches over and smoothes FREDDIE\\'s hair.\\n\\nZAKAR: I\\'m more concerned about the baby, of course.\\n\\nSARAH pulls FREDDIE out of his reach.\\n\\nSARAH: Freddie\\'s just fine.\\n\\nBut he isn\\'t. He\\'s still crying. ZAKAR reaches into his pocket and\\npulls out a coin. Be runs it over his fingers right in front of\\nFREDDIE\\'s face. The BABY stops crying.\\n\\nZAKAR: There, isn\\'t that better?\\n\\nSARAH (nervously): Uh, sure ... but you really have to leave ...\\n\\nZAKAR ignores her and heads into the living room.\\n\\nZAKAR: I\\'m not just a playwright, as you can see ... bring him in\\nhere and I\\'ll do some other tricks for him ...\\n\\nSARAH: No! You\\'ve got to ...\\n\\nBut he is already in the living room. She follows, still holding the\\nBABY.\\n\\n17\\tINT: LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\\n\\nZAKAR is sitting on the sofa, looking very comfortable. SARAH stands\\nin the doorway, not sure what to do. Reluctantly, she goes and sits\\ndown across from him.\\n\\nZAKAR: Now watch this, Freddie ...\\n\\nHe reaches into his breast pocket and tugs on the handkerchief there.\\nIt comes out followed by many others, all different colours. SARAH\\nrolls her eyes. This is not that exciting a trick. FREDDIE isn\\'t\\nimpressed, either. In fact he starts to cry again.\\n\\nZAKAR: So you\\'re going to be like that, are you, Freddie? Well, you\\nknow what that means?\\n\\nHe leans across the table and SARAH pulls the BABY closer.\\n\\nZAKAR: It\\'s time to call the goblins!\\n\\nSARAH: What?!!\\n\\nSARAH is surprised to hear this, to say the least. It echoes her\\nsilly threat to FREDDIE earlier.\\n\\nZAKAR: Yes. That\\'s what we do with bad babies ... we send for the\\ngoblins!!\\n\\nAnd with that he reaches into yet another pocket and pulls out a\\npoorly made, very silly-looking goblin hand puppet. SARAH laughs\\nwith relief. ZAKAR, his hand in the puppet, talks in a high-pitched,\\nunconvincing goblin voice.\\n\\nZAKAR: You like goblins, don\\'t\\'cha, Freddie? (singsong) but I bet\\nyour sister doesn\\'t ...\\n\\nSARAH rolls her eyes at this, and then gasps. Because for one very\\nstrange moment, the puppet keeps bouncing, but both of ZAKAR\\'s hands\\nare visible! And then the puppet seems to move away from the table,\\nand disappear! FREDDIE claps his hands with delight. SARAH jumps out\\nof her chair.\\n\\nSARAH: Where is it?!!!\\n\\nZAKAR points to a large cabinet against the wall.\\n\\nZAKAR: It\\'s in there.\\n\\nSARAH: Impossible!\\n\\nZAKAR: See for yourself.\\n\\nSARAH hesitates for a moment, and then places FREDDIE carefully on\\nthe rug. She then marches over to the cabinet and throws open the\\ndoor.\\n\\nANOTHER ANGLE\\n\\nthe puppet, grinning wildly from inside the cabinet.\\n\\nANOTHER ANGLE\\n\\nSARAH gasps and involuntarily slams the door. She whirls around to\\nface ZAKAR.\\n\\nSARAH: How did you do that?!!\\n\\nZAKAR leans back into the sofa.\\n\\nZAKAR: Magic.\\n\\nSARAH: Oh sure ...\\n\\nShe nods, skeptically. She can\\'t see -- but WE CAN DEFINITELY SEE --\\nthe cabinet door slowly open behind her, and out of it comes a tiny,\\nfierce-looking GOBLIN! This is not a puppet, but a living creature\\nthat moves quickly out of sight with an exaggerated tiptoe. SARAH is\\nbusy with another problem. She doesn\\'t see FREDDIE!\\n\\nSARAH: Where\\'s Freddie?!!\\n\\nZAKAR shrugs. In a panic, SARAH begins to look around this room. She\\ncalls for FREDDIE and, as she passes in front of the living room\\ndoorway, WE CAN SEE something scurry across the hallway. SARAH stops\\nand listens.\\n\\nSARAH: Freddie?\\n\\nBut it wasn\\'t a BABY she heard. Behind her there is more scurrying as\\nCREATURES begin to appear from various parts of the room. We hear\\nfaint snickering. She turns to ZAKAR, terrified.\\n\\nSARAH: Where is he?!!\\n\\nZAKAR points to the chair SARAH was sitting in. She is behind the\\nchair and can\\'t see anything. But when she comes around in front of\\nit she sees FREDDIE comfortably ensconced in the cushions. And he\\'s\\nplaying with the goblin puppet! SARAH reaches over and grabs the\\npuppet out of his hands. She flings it across the room and scoops up\\nthe BABY.\\n\\nSARAH: Who are you?!!!\\n\\nZAKAR throws back his head and laughs, then suddenly leaps off the\\nsofa and lands very close to her.\\n\\nZAKAR: I\\'ve been known by many names ... but the one I prefer is\\n_Jareth, King of the Goblins_!!!\\n\\nSARAH holds FREDDIE close and backs away.\\n\\nSARAH: I don\\'t believe this!\\n\\nAmidst thunder and lightning JARETH flings his arms up into the air,\\nand he is suddenly dressed in strange, medieval garb, a cloak\\nswirling around him. And what\\'s worse, much, much worse, is that\\nsuddenly GOBLINS are everywhere! Popping out of drawers, from under\\nchairs, swinging off the chandeliers. SARAH turns and runs out of the\\nroom.\\n\\n18\\tINT: FOYER - NIGHT\\n\\nIt\\'s worse in here! The GOBLINS are pouring down the stairs, SOME\\nslide down the bannister! SARAH tries running into another room, but\\nis soon back, followed by a DOZEN MORE! She barely makes it to the\\nfront door and struggles to open it with the BABY in her arms. The\\nGOBLINS pull her back and laugh wildly. They fling her right into\\nJARETH\\'s arms. He scoops FREDDIE up and whirls away from her. SARAH\\ntries to grab the BABY back but the GOBLINS get between them.\\n\\nSARAH (hysterical): Give him back, you monster! Give him back!\\n\\nJARETH only laughs and starts to swirl gracefully. FREDDIE laughs\\nwith delight and SARAH struggles to reach him. With a superhuman\\neffort she pushes through the MASS OF CREATURES and grabs onto\\nJARETH\\'s fluttering cloak. It\\'s like being caught up in a whirlwind\\nof incredible force.\\n\\nSARAH (screaming): I ... won\\'t ... let ... you ... take ... him!\\n\\nBut it\\'s too late. SARAH\\'s feet leave the ground and she is pulled\\nwith them and the whole MASS OF GOBLINS. JARETH and FREDDIE swirl up\\nthrough where the ceiling would have been, up into the blackness.\\nThere\\'s a QUICK MONTAGE OF SHOTS: JARETH\\'s laughing face; SARAH,\\ndesperate as her fingers are losing their grip; FREDDIE, who\\'s having\\na great time; GOBLINS, ALL gleeful; then -- JARETH\\'s garment pulls\\nout of SARAH\\'s grip. She falls OUT OF FRAME, a silent scream on her\\nface.\\n\\n19\\tEXT: LABYRINTH - DAY\\nA WIDE PEACEFUL SHOT\\n\\nThe sky is pink, and the WHITE BIRD swoops by us as WE TILT DOWN TO\\nSEE the exterior wall of the labyrinth. It is a high masonry wall\\nthat extends off in either direction. Along the wall are various\\nornamental bushes and there is a small figure of a dwarf, his back to\\nus, peeing into a tiny pond. It looks for all the world like one of\\nthose ornamental garden sculptures. But it isn\\'t. This is HOGGLE. In\\na CLOSER SHOT, which is quite discreet, HOGGLE finishes peeing, and\\ngoes over to a particularly lush shrub. A few butterfly-like\\ncreatures, flower fairies, flit around the bushes.\\n\\nHOGGLE: An\\' how\\'s me pride an\\' joy!\\n\\nHe leans forward to sniff one of the magnificent blossoms, sighing\\nwith pleasure as he does. But before he can indulge he is stopped by\\nthe whistling sound of a falling object. SARAH falls from the sky and\\nlands right on his prize shrub! Incensed, he screams with fury.\\n\\nHOGGLE: What is this? Look what you done! You murderer!\\n\\nSARAH struggles out of the broken shrub.\\n\\nSARAH: What are you saying, you horrible little man?!\\n\\nHOGGLE: I ain\\'t horrible, I\\'m _Hoggle_. And just look! You\\'ve\\ndestroyed me prize blossoms!\\n\\nHe realizes the extent of the damage to his prize specimen.\\n\\nHOGGLE: I\\'ll get ya for it, you big oaf!\\n\\nAnd he picks up a spray can and goes after SARAH. But she\\'s had\\nenough. After the nightmarish kidnapping of FREDDIE and a drop from\\nthe deepest space, this guy is child\\'s play. She reaches out and\\npulls the can from HOGGLE\\'s hands. She then grabs him by the\\nshirt-front and practically lifts him off the ground.\\n\\nSARAH: Oh no you don\\'t! If anyone\\'s getting anything around here,\\nit\\'s me ... now where\\' my brother?!!\\n\\nHOGGLE: I ain\\'t sayin\\' nothin\\' \\'til ye let me go!\\n\\nSARAH sighs and lets go.\\n\\nSARAH: I\\'m sorry. But this just hasn\\'t been my day.\\n\\nHOGGLE looks at his crushed shrub again.\\n\\nHOGGLE: Ye ain\\'t the only one.\\n\\nSARAH ignores him and stares at the massive wall behind them.\\n\\nSARAH: And I don\\'t understand any of this!\\n\\nHOGGLE shakes his head and sighs.\\n\\nHOGGLE: Now where have I heard that before.\\n\\nSARAH: What do you mean?\\n\\nHOGGLE: I mean, everyone who comes here thinkin\\' they can make it\\nthrough the labyrinth says sumthin\\' like (mimicking Sarah in a whiny,\\nhigh pitch) ... I don\\'t understand this, whatever am I doing here,\\nhow will I ever get home ...\\n\\nSARAH: What makes you think I\\'m here to get through a labyrinth?\\n\\nHOGGLE shakes his head again.\\n\\nHOGGLE: Can\\'t think of any reason why you\\'d be standin\\' here in front\\no\\' this gate if you weren\\'t.\\n\\nSARAH doesn\\'t understand what he is talking about but when she looks\\nup she can\\'t believe her eyes.\\n\\nANOTHER ANGLE\\n\\nA huge gate where just a moment ago there nothing but smooth, endless\\nwall. SARAH gulps in disbelief. Then the huge wooden doors fly open\\nand a terrified CREATURE runs out, full speed, screaming for his\\nlife. Right behind him come TWO MENACING GOBLINS riding on strange\\nBEASTS. They are armed and dangerous looking. They quickly catch up\\nwith the CREATURE and drag him, screaming piteously, back through the\\ngate. Before the gates close SARAH can see MORE GOBLINS, what seems\\nlike hundreds of them. SOME are mounted, MOST of them are armed. And\\nbeyond them a walled passageway seems to go on forever. Then the\\nwooden doors slam shut.\\n\\nSARAH: Oh, no! Not more goblins!\\n\\nHOGGLE: That\\'s Jareth\\'s goblin army, and that other poor fool musta\\nbeen caught meanderin\\' where he had no business.\\n\\nSARAH: What will they do to him?\\n\\nHOGGLE: I don\\'t like to think about things like that.\\n\\nSARAH shudders.\\n\\nSARAH: I wonder if things can get any worse?\\n\\nHOGGLE sighs knowingly.\\n\\nHOGGLE: He\\'s taken sumthin\\' o\\' yours, ain\\'t he?\\n\\nSARAH is clearly surprised.\\n\\nHOGGLE: Jareth, our high an\\' mighty king ...\\n\\nSARAH nods, excited that someone has a grasp of the situation.\\n\\nHOGGLE: Bet he\\'s gone and taken sumthin\\' you love.\\n\\nSARAH (shrugging): Close. He\\'s got my baby brother.\\n\\nHOGGLE laughs derisively.\\n\\nHOGGLE: Baby snatchin\\'! That\\'s low.\\n\\nSARAH: So I\\'ve just got to do something!\\n\\nHOGGLE: Like what?\\n\\nSARAH: Get Freddie back, of course!\\n\\nHOGGLE: Then ya\\'d have ta make it through the labyrinth, \\'cause\\nJareth\\'s castle is at its very center.\\n\\nSARAH looks at the gates and gulps.\\n\\nSARAH: Is it difficult?\\n\\nHOGGLE snorts with derision.\\n\\nHOGGLE: Is me prize shrub crushed into oblivion?\\n\\nSARAH is reaching the breaking point.\\n\\nSARAH: Look, I\\'m sorry about your bush! But it\\'s not like I asked to\\nhave some weirdo come and take my baby brother and then drop me out\\nof the sky!\\n\\nHOGGLE: Well, I didn\\'t ask for some overgrown flower fairy to drop on\\nme prized possession, neither!\\n\\nSARAH: Oh, this is ridiculous!\\n\\nAnd she stalks off to the gate, mumbling all the way.\\n\\nSARAH (to herself): ... standing here wasting time talking to some\\nweird guy who should be living under a bridge ...\\n\\nShe is almost at the gate when she freezes with fear. Through the\\ngate she can hear the cheers and jeers of the GOBLINS, and what might\\nbe the wailing of their poor CAPTIVE. There\\'s no way she wants to\\nrisk facing that horrific CREW. HOGGLE has come up behind her and as\\nshe backs away from the gate she bumps into him. She shrieks and\\nwhirls around.\\n\\nHOGGLE: That ain\\'t the only way in, ya know!\\n\\nSARAH is very relieved to hear this.\\n\\nSARAH: It\\'s not?!\\n\\nHOGGLE: Course it ain\\'t. There\\'s many a route in ... just only one\\nway out.\\n\\nSARAH: Well show me one! I\\'ve got to find my brother!\\n\\nHOGGLE sighs impatiently. Be fingers a belt that he wears, rattling\\nit in an obvious manner. It in hung with every kind of watch and\\nbracelet and ring you can imagine.\\n\\nHOGGLE: Information like that has a price ...\\n\\nSARAH, taken aback by the amount of loot he\\'s acquired.\\n\\nSARAH: I could give you this ...\\n\\nShe takes the gold circlet off her head. HOGGLE isn\\'t interested.\\n\\nHOGGLE: I had sumthin\\' o\\' this caliber in mind ...\\n\\nHe takes her hand and WE SEE that she is wearing a beautiful ruby\\nring. SARAH shakes her head vehemently.\\n\\nSARAH: No. My mother gave me that.\\n\\nHOGGLE eyes it greedily.\\n\\nHOGGLE: She could give ya another ...\\n\\nSARAH: No, she couldn\\'t. (sadness crosses her face suddenly) She\\nlives real far away ...\\n\\nThe sadness disappears just as suddenly. She holds out the circlet.\\n\\nSARAH: This is all you get.\\n\\nHe grabs the circlet and bites it.\\n\\nHOGGLE: Bah! It\\'s paste!\\n\\nSomething catches SARAH\\'s eye. It is one of the tiny FLOWER FAIRIES.\\nShe leans over for a better look.\\n\\nSARAH: No it\\'s not, it\\'s plastic.\\n\\nHOGGLE\\'s eyes light up at that and he grunts with satisfaction as he\\nstrings the circlet onto his belt. SARAH reaches out her hand to the\\nFAIRY.\\n\\nSARAH: What a beautiful little thing ...\\n\\nHOGGLE reaches for the spray can.\\n\\nHOGGLE: Let me at it!\\n\\nSARAH is enraged.\\n\\nSARAH: You murderer! How can you kill such beautiful creatures?!!\\n\\nJust then the FAIRY gives SARAH a vicious bite. She shakes it off her\\nhand and cries out in pain.\\n\\nSARAH: It bit me!\\n\\nHOGGLE quickly sprays the offending FAIRY and it falls to the earth,\\nscreaming all the way.\\n\\nHOGGLE: Of course it bit ya! There\\'s nuthin\\' more vicious than a\\nflower fairy. Any fool knows that!\\n\\nSARAH sucks on her wounded hand and tries not to cry.\\n\\nHOGGLE (sighs): But you don\\'t know nuthin\\', do ya?\\n\\nA tear trickles down SARAH\\'s cheek. HOGGLE sighs.\\n\\nHOGGLE: I got a feelin\\' I\\'m gonna regret this. (he stalks off) Come\\nwith me an\\' I\\'ll show ya a way in.\\n\\nSARAH hurries after him. As they walk along the endless wall HOGGLE\\nlooks at the circlet and polishes it on his sleeve.\\n\\nHOGGLE (thrilled): Plastic!\\n\\n20\\tEXT: LABYRINTH - DAY\\n\\nAnother part of the wall. HOGGLE pushes a bush aside and shows SARAH\\na tiny door. She looks at it dubiously.\\n\\nHOGGLE: This\\'ll take ya into the maze, that\\'s the first part of the\\nlabyrinth ...\\n\\nSARAH: The first part! What comes after that?\\n\\nHOGGLE gets down on his knees and starts to crawl through the door.\\n\\nHOGGLE: Then there\\'s the Garden Maze, then the Forbidden Forest ...\\n\\nSARAH: That sounds inviting ...\\n\\nHe is through the door. He is still talking but SARAH can\\'t hear him.\\nShe quickly tries to follow.\\n\\nSARAH: Wait! Wait! I can\\'t hear you ...\\n\\n21\\tINT: LABYRINTH - DAY\\n\\nHOGGLE is through the door.\\n\\nHOGGLE: ... then comes the castle ...\\n\\nSARAH\\'s head appears.\\n\\nHOGGLE: ... that\\'s surely where Jareth\\'s keepin\\' the babe ...\\n\\nHe looks down at SARAH, she is through the door to her waist and\\nstraining to get the rest of herself through. HOGGLE sighs and grabs\\nher hand. With a groan he tugs on her and pulls her through the\\ndoorway. She lands flat on her face.\\n\\nHOGGLE: Ya don\\'t seem ta be able ta do nuthin\\' without my help, do ya?\\n\\nHe chuckles and SARAH gives him a look that could kill as she gets up\\nand dusts herself off. She looks around and the environment seems\\nrather benign. The brick walls are open to the sky, here and there a\\nflower peeks through a crack.\\n\\nSARAH: Oh, I think I can handle it. In fact, this place doesn\\'t seem\\nso bad at all.\\n\\nAnd with that, she jauntily heads down the nearest corridor.\\n\\n22\\tINT: CORRIDOR 1 - DAY\\n\\nSARAH turns a corner and comes face to face with a FACE. It is huge\\nand grotesque and protrudes out of the wall.\\n\\nFACE: Go back! Go back before it\\'s too late!\\n\\nSARAH screams and backs away from it, moving further down the\\ncorridor. She backs into something and whirls around. It is ANOTHER\\nFACE.\\n\\nFACE 2: Turn back while you still can!!\\n\\nSARAH turns and runs back the way she came.\\n\\nSARAH: Hoggle!\\n\\n23\\tINT: LABYRINTH - DAY\\n\\nHOGGLE is still standing by the door, an amused smile on his face.\\nSARAH comes rushing toward him.\\n\\nSARAH: Oh, I\\'m so glad you\\'re still here! They were horrible ...\\n\\nHOGGLE: You don\\'t mean the False Alarms, do ya?\\n\\nHe shakes his head and goes off in the direction that SARAH just came\\nfrom.\\n\\nHOGGLE: If ya gonna let a little thing like them scare ya, Missy, ya\\nhaven\\'t a hope o\\' makin\\' it to the castle.\\n\\nSARAH quickly follows.\\n\\nSARAH: False Alarms?\\n\\n24\\tINT: CORRIDOR 1 - DAY\\n\\nThe corridor of faces. HOGGLE enters and the FACES start in on their\\nroutine. SARAH comes up behind him, shuddering at the ghastly sight.\\n\\nFACE 1: This is the path of no return!\\n\\nFACE 2: Beware! Beware!\\n\\nHOGGLE: Just ignore \\'em.\\n\\nSARAH: Are you sure?\\n\\nHOGGLE sighs and turns to the NEXT FACE.\\n\\nFACE 3: Abandon all hope ...\\n\\nHOGGLE: Oh, shut up, will ya?\\n\\nSARAH is wide-eyed at HOGGLE\\'s defiance.\\n\\nFACE 3: But I was just getting to the best part!\\n\\nHOGGLE: All right. But don\\'t expect us to pay any attention.\\n\\nFACE 3 (winks at Sarah): You\\'re going to love this ... Abandon all\\nhope ye who enter here, for this is the road to destruction!!!\\n\\nHOGGLE (bored): Very nice ...\\n\\nSARAH is dumbstruck. HOGGLE takes her hand and yanks her along.\\n\\nFACE 3: Come back any time ... I mean, you\\'re doomed, doomed!\\n\\n25\\tINT: CORRIDOR 2 - DAY\\n\\nHOGGLE and SARAH continuing down a similar corridor.\\n\\nHOGGLE: Ya see, things aren\\'t always what they appear to be around\\nhere, Missy ...\\n\\nSARAH (shrugging): Whatever. All I\\'m interested in is getting my\\nbrother back from that creep.\\n\\nShe starts to look around for something.\\n\\nHOGGLE: I admire yer determination, but it takes more\\'n that to beat\\nJareth.\\n\\nSARAH picks up a rock.\\n\\nSARAH: Well, maybe I\\'m beginning to get the hang of this labyrinth\\nbusiness.\\n\\nShe takes the rock and uses it to mark an X on the floor.\\n\\nSARAH: See, now I\\'ll know which way we came in case I get lost.\\n\\nHOGGLE (sighs): Missy, goin\\' back the way ya came is par fer the\\ncourse around here, what ya want to do is go forward.\\n\\nSARAH: Look, Hoggle! I\\'ve got to find Freddie and I don\\'t need you to\\ndiscourage me!\\n\\nHOGGLE: And I don\\'t need to be wastin\\' me time goin\\' around in\\ncircles with you!\\n\\nSARAH: That\\'s fine with me! (she starts off) I know you\\'re only after\\nmy ring, anyway!\\n\\nShe turns a corner and HOGGLE looks after her, hurt and pity crossing\\nhis face. He takes a few steps in her direction and an officious\\nlittle creature, a BRICKKEEPER, emerges from the brickwork of the\\nfloor, takes out the cobblestone that SARAH marked, and replaces it\\nwith the marked side hidden. It looks up at HOGGLE.\\n\\nBRICKKEEPER: Some people got no respect for property!\\n\\nHOGGLE sticks his tongue out at the CREATURE just as it goes back\\ninto its hole.\\n\\n26\\tEXT: AERIAL SHOT - DAY\\n\\nThe WHITE BIRD flies over the maze and WE SEE SARAH marching along.\\nShe thinks she\\'s going forward but she\\'s heading right for HOGGLE.\\n\\n27\\tINT: CORRIDOR 2 - DAY\\n\\nSARAH emerges into the corridor and comes face to face with HOGGLE.\\n\\nSARAH: But ...\\n\\nShe whirls around to look behind her, then back at HOGGLE again.\\n\\nSARAH: ... but you were just behind me! I\\'m sure of it!\\n\\nHOGGLE shakes his head as she runs by him and looks down at the floor.\\n\\nSARAH: My mark! It was right here!\\n\\nHOGGLE comes up beside her.\\n\\nHOGGLE: I told ya, Missy. Things aren\\'t what they appear to be around\\nhere ...\\n\\nJARETH (VO): Except when they are.\\n\\nANOTHER ANGLE\\n\\nJARETH, in all his glory. SARAH and HOGGLE whirl around and BOTH gasp\\nwith surprise and fear.\\n\\nJARETH: We meet again ... Sarah.\\n\\nSARAH: Where\\'s Freddie?!! What have you done with him!?\\n\\nShe starts to rush toward JARETH but HOGGLE holds her back.\\n\\nJARETH: Nothing ... yet.\\n\\nHe walks toward them and they automatically step backwards. He looks\\ndown at HOGGLE.\\n\\nJARETH: And what have we here ... Hoghead, isn\\'t it?\\n\\nHOGGLE is humiliated.\\n\\nHOGGLE: Me name\\'s Hoggle.\\n\\nJARETH: Ah, yes. Now I remember. (he moves closer to Hoggle) You\\'re\\nthe greedy little coward who lives outside the gate. Shouldn\\'t you be\\nback there minding your own business ... Hedgehog?\\n\\nHe chucks HOGGLE under the chin, and is quite rough about it. HOGGLE\\nfumes silently. SARAH doesn\\'t like this.\\n\\nSARAH: Why, why don\\'t you pick on someone your own size?\\n\\nHe looks her up and down.\\n\\nJARETH: Whom did you have in mind?\\n\\nSARAH tries to brazen it out.\\n\\nSARAH: I don\\'t have time for any games. I want Freddie, and I want\\nhim now!\\n\\nJARETH throws back his head and laughs.\\n\\nJARETH: Ah, Freddie. An adorable little imp. I\\'m really growing\\nrather fond of him.\\n\\nSARAH: Where is he?!!\\n\\nJARETH: He\\'s in my castle, and seems to be enjoying himself immensely.\\n\\nHe ambles toward them and they can\\'t help themselves, they BOTH step\\nbackwards.\\n\\nJARETH: In fact, he likes being with goblins so much, I\\'m considering\\nturning him into one.\\n\\nSARAH thinks this is crazy.\\n\\nSARAH: You can\\'t do that!\\n\\nJARETH (grinning): Oh yes I can.\\n\\nSARAH looks down at HOGGLE and speaks under her breath.\\n\\nSARAH: Can he?\\n\\nHOGGLE nods glumly.\\n\\nJARETH: But let\\'s make it interesting. I won\\'t do it for ... thirteen\\nhours. If you make it to the castle before then you might be able to\\nsave him. If not, well, I think little Freddie will mike an adorable\\ngoblin prince, don\\'t you?\\n\\nHe laughs and holds up both hands and WE SEE that they are empty. He\\nthen closes them and when he opens them again there is a gold watch\\nin one hand. He throws it to SARAH, but HOGGLE intercepts it and eyes\\nit greedily. Annoyed, SARAH snatches it out of his hand. She looks at\\nit and sees that it has 13 hours marked on it. When she looks up\\nagain, JARETH is gone.\\n\\nWORM (VO): Well, good riddance to bad rubbish!\\n\\nSARAH and HOGGLE BOTH jump and then look at where the voice is coming\\nfrom. It is a little WORM, poking its head out of a hole in the\\nbrickwork.\\n\\nWORM: That\\'s what the missus always says, she does. Why the last time\\nshe found that one around here she sent him packing.\\n\\nSARAH: Jareth?!\\n\\nWORM: She don\\'t take to his kind of nonsense, that\\'s for sure. Now,\\nhow about a nice cup of tea? The missus has a kettle on.\\n\\nSARAH looks down at HOGGLE, who shrugs. She then looks up at the WORM\\nand gives him a beaming smile.\\n\\n28\\tINT: CORRIDOR 2 - DAY\\n\\nSARAH and HOGGLE are sitting on the floor.\\n\\nSARAH: Do you think Jareth will give Freddie back if I make it on\\ntime?\\n\\nHOGGLE: It\\'s hard to say, Missy. But if I were you, I\\'d worry \\'bout\\nfirst things first.\\n\\nSARAH: What do you mean?\\n\\nHOGGLE: I means ya got ta find the castle before ya can go savin\\' the\\nbabe and I mean ta see that ya do!\\n\\nSARAH is thrilled and leans over and gives him a kiss on the cheek.\\n\\nSARAH: Oh, Hoggle! Thank you, thank you so much!\\n\\nHOGGLE gets all flustered and tries to act gruff.\\n\\nHOGGLE: Seems to me I could be gettin\\' that ring from ya after all if\\nI plays me cards right.\\n\\nSARAH regards him affectionately.\\n\\nSARAH: I know you don\\'t mean that. You\\'re helping me because you\\'re\\nreally nice.\\n\\nHOGGLE: I ain\\'t nice! I just likes the way ya stood up ta him is all.\\n(he is thoughtful for a moment; almost to himself) Too bad more\\'ve us\\nhaven\\'t had the guts to do the same.\\n\\nThe WORM reappears.\\n\\nWORM: How about a biscuit? The missus just took a fresh batch out of\\nthe oven.\\n\\nSARAH: Thanks, but we really don\\'t have any time. We\\'ve got to get to\\nthe castle.\\n\\nHOGGLE: Ya wouldn\\'t happen to know a shortcut, would ya?\\n\\nWORM: Well, you might try taking that first left.\\n\\nSARAH and HOGGLE look down the corridor.\\n\\nSARAH: But there isn\\'t any left turn.\\n\\nJust then a strange FIGURE seems to come through the left wall and\\nwalks toward them. He is dressed in long flowing robes and wears a\\nhat shaped like a bird.\\n\\nWORM: See, there\\'s a left turn right there, where that Wise One just\\ncame in.\\n\\nSARAH: A Wise One! Maybe he knows the best way to the castle!\\n\\nHOGGLE: I wouldn\\'t bet on it.\\n\\nBut SARAH is excited about the possibility of getting more help.\\n\\nSARAH: Excuse me, Sir. Could you tell us the best way to get to the\\ncastle?\\n\\nWISE ONE: The best way to the castle, hmmm. I\\'m glad you asked that\\nquestion.\\n\\nTo SARAH\\'s and HOGGLE\\'s surprise, the HAT joins into the conversation.\\n\\nHAT: Now you\\'ve done it, gone and asked him a question. We\\'ll be here\\nall day!\\n\\nWISE ONE: A castle, or fortress, or as it is sometimes known, a\\nstronghold or citadel -- or, that which has a turret and barbican,\\nbut usually not a portcullis ...\\n\\nHAT: What did I tell you? There\\'s no stopping him now.\\n\\nWISE ONE: ... often there is a rampart or bulwark, and then a parapet\\n-- perchance an actual vallum or counterscarp ...\\n\\nHAT: Shut up down there!\\n\\nWISE ONE: ... and for entrenchment; a moat, drawbridge and sally-port\\n...\\n\\nSARAH looks at HOGGLE.\\n\\nSARAH: This was not one of my better ideas.\\n\\nHAT: Well, I told you that, didn\\'t I? But nobody ever listens to me!\\n\\nHe looks down at the still mumbling WISE ONE.\\n\\nHAT: Enough! Nobody cares!!\\n\\nThe WISE ONE blinks and looks at SARAH and HOGGLE.\\n\\nWISE ONE: Did one of you say something?\\n\\nSARAH thinks quickly.\\n\\nSARAH: Oh, no. We never talk to strangers.\\n\\nWISE ONE: That\\'s very wise. An idea worth savoring.\\n\\nHOGGLE nudges him.\\n\\nHOGGLE: Yeah, but keep it under your hat!\\n\\nHOGGLE thinks this is hilarious. The HAT doesn\\'t.\\n\\nHAT: Ve-ry funny!\\n\\nThe WISE ONE continues on his way.\\n\\nWISE ONE: The stranger, hmm. I\\'m glad you brought that up. The\\nstranger; one not indigenous, also known as the alien, or one from\\nbeyond the sea ...\\n\\nHAT (hysterical): I quit! I can\\'t take it anymore!\\n\\nAnd then they are gone, passing through the righthand wall as if it\\nwasn\\'t there. SARAH watches after them, stunned.\\n\\nSARAH: How did he do that?!!\\n\\nHOGGLE: And how can we make sure he doesn\\'t come back?\\n\\nSARAH gives him a look and turns to the WORM.\\n\\nWORM: Just go over to that bit of wall there and walk right through\\nit. The important thing is to forget what you think you know. It\\ndoesn\\'t apply around here.\\n\\nSARAH and HOGGLE walk down to the part of the wall where the WISE ONE\\nentered. Once there, they can see that a section of the wall is\\nactually a passageway-width behind the rest of the wall. SARAH yells\\nback to the WORM.\\n\\nSARAH: Thank you! And tell the missus we\\'re sorry we missed her\\nbiscuits!\\n\\nAnd then they walk through the wall and are gone.\\n\\n29\\tINT: CORRIDOR 3 - DAY\\n\\nSARAH and HOGGLE appear through the wall and SARAH laughs with\\ndelight. HOGGLE wasn\\'t as pleased with the experience and feels the\\nwall as if testing to see if it really happened. SARAH sees that they\\nare in a corridor where the walls are crumbling and she climbs up to\\nthe top of one and looks over.\\n\\nANOTHER ANGLE\\n\\nSARAH\\'S POV - THE TURRETS OF THE CASTLE\\n\\nSARAH (excited): I can see the castle! It doesn\\'t look far at all!\\n\\nHOGGLE is still feeling around the wall, trying to figure out how\\nthey got there. SARAH jumps down and starts to run down the corridor.\\n\\nSARAH: Come on, Hoggle. Let\\'s go!\\n\\nHOGGLE sees her retreating figure and hurries after her.\\n\\n30\\tINT: CASTLE - DAY\\n\\nJARETH\\'s great hall. He stands by a window and looks out over the\\nlabyrinth -- from this vantage point he can see clear across it: the\\nhovels that surround the castle walls, the arid plain that leads to\\nthe dense forest, encircling that, the complex maze. He seems lost in\\nthought. The WHITE BIRD enters the window and lands on his shoulder.\\nBehind him FREDDIE is having a grand time. His slippery crawl is too\\nmuch for the GOBLINS that scurry about, trying to mind him.\\nMeanwhile, a particularly stupid looking GOBLIN begins to approach\\nJARETH. He saunters across the room and is stopped short by a FEMALE\\nGOBLIN. She grabs hold of his shirt and hisses a warning.\\n\\nFEMALE GOBLIN: Remember! It\\'s bow and scrape ... bow and scrape ...\\n\\nThe STUPID GOBLIN nods and she lets him go. He then continues his\\napproach to JARETH, only this time he does a little bow and then\\nscrapes his foot across the floor, then repeats the action.\\n\\nSTUPID GOBLIN (to himself): Bow \\'n scrape ... bow \\'n scrape ...\\n\\nJARETH turns and sees the GOBLIN.\\n\\nJARETH: Well, what is it?\\n\\nThe GOBLIN can\\'t answer and do his bow-and-scrape at the same time so\\ncontinues his painfully slow approach.\\n\\nSTUPID GOBLIN: ... bow \\'n scrape ... bow \\'n scrape ...\\n\\nAnnoyed, JARETH walks over to the GOBLIN and lifts him up by his\\nshirt front. The GOBLIN is still bowing.\\n\\nJARETH: I said, what is it?!!!\\n\\nSTUPID GOBLIN: Th ... the girl and Hoggle, sire. Th ... they\\'re\\nhalfway th .... through th ... the maze.\\n\\nJARETH drops the GOBLIN hard on the floor. FREDDIE sees this and\\nlaughs with delight. JARETH walks over and scoops the BABY up in his\\narms. He then carries him over to the window. He calls over to an\\nARMED GOBLIN by the door.\\n\\nJARETH: I think it\\'s time they had some company.\\n\\nARMED GOBLIN: Yes, Sir!\\n\\nBe then salutes, causing his visor to close on his face, then\\nstumbles around looking for the door. JARETH shakes his head.\\n\\nJARETH: You\\'ll make a much better goblin than that, won\\'t you,\\nFreddie!\\n\\nFREDDIE\\'s response is to clap his sticky baby\\'s hand on to JARETH\\'s\\nface. JARETH, pretending he doesn\\'t mind, carefully removes it. He\\nthen looks down to the courtyard below.\\n\\n31\\tEXT: CASTLE - DAY\\nJARETH\\'S POV\\n\\nARMED GOBLINS are pouring out of the castle.\\n\\n32\\tEXT: CORRIDOR 4 - DAY\\n\\nSARAH and HOGGLE are striding down a corridor. They are about to come\\nto a corner.\\n\\nSARAH: Are you sure Jareth can turn Freddie into a goblin? I mean,\\nthat\\'s really weird ...\\n\\nThey turn the corner and HOGGLE stops short. SARAH becomes alarmed.\\n\\nSARAH: What is it?\\n\\nHOGGLE gestures for her to be quiet and then we can hear what he\\nhears -- marching. They look back the way they came.\\n\\nANOTHER ANGLE\\n\\nSARAH\\'S AND HOGGLE\\'S POV - A BATTALION OF ARMED GOBLINS, marching\\nright towards them!\\n\\nANOTHER ANGLE\\n\\nThey look at each other, then turn and run. HOGGLE tries to get\\nthrough the wall the way the WORM showed them.\\n\\nHOGGLE (quoting the worm): Just forget what you think you know and ...\\n\\nHe smacks headlong into the wall. He stops to rub his nose and SARAH\\nflies by him.\\n\\nSARAH: Come on!\\n\\n33\\tINT: CASTLE - DAY\\n\\nFREDDIE is now sitting on the lap of a GOBLIN, happily bopping it on\\nthe nose. JARETH snaps his fingers and a GROUP of sleepy MUSICIANS in\\nthe corner stumble over themselves to pick up their instruments. They\\nbegin to play and JARETH looks out the window and begins a song. He\\nsings about the labyrinth; what it is -- his domain, and what it is\\nto OTHERS -- a test, a proving-ground, not for the faint of heart.\\n\\n34\\tINT: MAZE MONTAGE - DAY\\n\\nWhile JARETH sings, SARAH and HOGGLE try to escape from the GOBLINS.\\nThey get a lead on them for a while and come to another corridor with\\ncrumbling walls. They scamper up to get a look at their position and\\nsee dust rising from several parts of the maze. The GOBLINS are\\neverywhere.\\n\\nIn another corridor, they are stopped in their tracks by DOZENS OF\\nLITTLE FUZZY CREATURES who scurry towards them out of the way of the\\noncoming GOBLINS. They turn and run back the way they came and as\\nthey do WALL CREATURES chatter nervously and then disappear into the\\ncracks between the bricks.\\n\\nIn a corridor with very short walls they are able to see the tips of\\nspears on either side of them, going in the opposite direction.\\n\\nThey enter a corridor with several arches curving over it, forming\\nsmall, intermittent bridges. Thinking they are safe, they stop for a\\nbreath, and soon realize that a BATTALION is right behind them. They\\nscurry up the walls, and as the song comes to an end, they each lie\\nacross an arch hopefully out of sight of the GOBLINS below.\\n\\n35\\tINT: ARCHED CORRIDOR - DAY\\n\\nSARAH and HOGGLE huddle above the corridor on their arches as TWO\\nGOBLINS bring up the rear.\\n\\nGOBLIN 1: I can kill better than you can.\\n\\nGOBLIN 2: But I\\'m better at maiming. Everybody says so.\\n\\nAnd they are gone. Shaken, SARAH and HOGGLE slide down from their\\nhiding places.\\n\\nSARAH: Do you think they\\'re gone?\\n\\nHOGGLE: Sure they are. Goblins ain\\'t known fer their intelligence, ya\\nknow. They has as much trouble findin\\' their way through the maze as\\nyou do.\\n\\nHe folds his arms and leans against the wall.\\n\\nSARAH: I\\'m not sure, but I think you just called me stupid ...\\n\\nSuddenly HOGGLE yells and disappears. He has accidentally leaned on\\nanother secret wall opening. SARAH quickly follows.\\n\\n36\\tINT: CORRIDOR 5 - DAY\\n\\nHOGGLE and SARAH are now in the long circular corridor that divides\\nthe maze from the beginning of the second ring of the labyrinth --\\nthe Garden Maze.\\n\\nHOGGLE (excited): I think I know where we are!\\n\\nSARAH: That\\'ll be a nice change.\\n\\nHe ignores her and looks around excitedly.\\n\\nHOGGLE: This place is the end o\\' the maze! That means we\\'re near the\\nentrance ta the second ring o\\' the labyrinth.\\n\\nSARAH: The second ring? What\\'s that?\\n\\nHOGGLE starts down the corridor.\\n\\nHOGGLE (happily): The Garden Maze!\\n\\nSARAH (gloomy): Sounds like a great place ... what\\'s it like?\\n\\nHOGGLE: Don\\'t know, I ain\\'t never made it this far before.\\n\\nHe is skipping happily down the corridor when SARAH hears something.\\nIt is a strange clanking sound.\\n\\nSARAH (frightened): Hoggle! What\\'s that sound?!!\\n\\nHOGGLE stops skipping and sighs.\\n\\nHOGGLE: Now don\\'t go gettin\\' all girly on me, Missy, now that we\\'s\\nfinally safe ...\\n\\nSARAH: So you think we\\'re safe, do you?\\n\\nHOGGLE (annoyed): Didn\\'t I just say so?!!\\n\\nSARAH: Then tell me what you think of that.\\n\\nSARAH points behind them where the clanking noise is coming from. It\\nis now much louder. HOGGLE comes over to her and takes a better look.\\nHe screams.\\n\\nANOTHER ANGLE\\n\\nTHEIR POV - A SLASHING MACHINE is coming right towards them. (A\\nslashing wall is made up of rows of furiously spinning knives, and\\nchopping cleavers, and has brushes along the bottom to clean up\\nwhatever it encounters in its path.) And there is no way around it\\nbecause it completely fills the corridor.\\n\\nANOTHER ANGLE\\n\\nHOGGLE desperately tries to walk through the wall the way they came\\nin, but it is to no avail. He just keeps smashing his face. SARAH\\nstarts to run for it.\\n\\nSARAH: Come on!\\n\\nHOGGLE follows, every so often trying, and failing, to get through\\nthe wall.\\n\\nANOTHER ANGLE\\n\\nSARAH, who is far ahead of HOGGLE, comes to a door! And hanging on a\\nhook next to it is a bunch of keys. She looks back at HOGGLE.\\n\\nSARAH: Hoggle, hurry!\\n\\nANOTHER ANGLE\\n\\nSARAH\\'S POV - HOGGLE running toward her, and making slow but steady\\nprogress toward them BOTH -- the slashing machine.\\n\\nANOTHER ANGLE\\n\\nSARAH fumbles with the keys, furiously trying key after key in the\\ndoor but to no avail. She is terrified.\\n\\nSARAH: None of the keys work!\\n\\nDesperate, she starts banging on the door. HOGGLE is just a few yards\\naway from her.\\n\\nHOGGLE: Why don\\'t you just try it?\\n\\nHe then tries once more to walk through the wall. SARAH tries the\\nknob and sure enough, it opens. She is delighted. What she doesn\\'t\\nsee is HOGGLE suddenly disappearing through the floor.\\n\\nSARAH: It\\'s open! Hog ...\\n\\nShe turns around and he is gone! And the slashing machine is just a\\nfew yards away! She screams and, in her terror, falls backwards\\nthrough the door. It slams shut just as the slashing machine reaches\\nit WE CAN SEE that FOUR GOBLINS in sanitation workers\\' uniforms have\\nbeen pushing the machine all along. They grunt and strain, cranking\\nthe wheels that turn the knives and pushing all at the same time.\\n\\n37\\tINT: PICTURE GALLERY - DAY\\n\\nSARAH emerges into a large room. The walls are covered with large\\npaintings in ornate gilt frames. She is a bit stunned by the clone\\ncall with the slashing machine as she approaches the first painting.\\n\\nSARAH (to herself): What in the world ...\\n\\nShe stops short in front of the first painting and cannot believe her\\neyes. It is a painting of the watch with 13 hours on it. The hour\\nhand is on the 9. SARAH fumbles into her pocket and finds the watch\\nthat Jareth gave her. It also has the hour hand on the 9.\\n\\nSARAH: Only 9 hours left!\\n\\nThe next picture is of a BABY surrounded by gruesome GOBLINS. On\\ncloser inspection, the BABY is obviously FREDDIE. She chokes back a\\nsob and runs over to the next one, it is a picture of a rotunda with\\nstaircases going off in all different directions on different planes\\nof gravity. It is an Escher room, and a closer look shows a GOBLIN\\nhappily standing on the ceiling. She shakes her head and goes by the\\nnext painting and gasps involuntarily. It is a compelling portrait of\\nJARETH, and she moves even closer. Then she shakes herself out of it.\\n\\nANOTHER ANGLE\\n\\nTHE PORTRAIT\\'S POV - SARAH wills herself away and moves on, and we\\nhear the sound of JARETH\\'s breathing.\\n\\nANOTHER ANGLE\\n\\nSARAH is nervous and eagerly looks for a way out. She rushes by\\nanother painting, giving it merely a glance. But something makes her\\ngo back for a better look. It is of a lovely, manicured hedge maze.\\nIn the distance WE CAN SEE the turrets of JARETH\\'s castle. And in the\\nsky nearby flies a beautiful WHITE BIRD. And then SARAH is amazed by\\nwhat she sees. A closer look at the painting reveals that the WHITE\\nBIRD is flying! It moves over the hedges and WE SEE a FIGURE waving.\\n\\nSARAH: Hoggle!\\n\\nSARAH, disturbed, backs away from the painting. And then, because it\\nreally is as wonderful as it is scary, she goes back for another look\\nand over her shoulder WE CAN SEE HOGGLE waving and we hear his tiny\\nvoice.\\n\\nHOGGLE: Missy! Over here! This is the way to the castle!\\n\\nAnd SARAH strains to hear, and leans toward the painting, stretching\\nher hand out and touching the painting, which makes it turn into a\\nshimmering wall that her hand goes right through. And then she\\ndisappears right through the painting.\\n\\nANOTHER ANGLE\\n\\nTHE GALLERY. And JARETH\\'s portrait is now blank.\\n\\n38\\tEXT: HEDGE MAZE - DAY\\n\\nSARAH rushes up to HOGGLE and throws her arms around him.\\n\\nSARAH: What happened to you? I was afraid I\\'d never see you again!\\n\\nHOGGLE: Ya know that trick with the wall? Damn, if it don\\'t work with\\nthe floor, as well!\\n\\nSARAH laughs and hugs him again.\\n\\n39\\tINT : HEDGE MAZE - DAY\\n\\nSARAH and HOGGLE have been walking through the maze a long time. They\\nare tired and bedraggled. SARAH pulls the watch out of her pocket and\\nsighs.\\n\\nSARAH: An hour\\'s gone by and I don\\'t think we\\'re more than four feet\\nfrom where we started.\\n\\nHOGGLE: That\\'s \\'cause ya won\\'t do what I tells ya. It\\'s clear as day\\nwe should be goin\\' this way ...\\n\\nHe turns a corner and walks smack into a hedge dead end. He howls in\\npain and SARAH sighs and follows him.\\n\\nANOTHER ANGLE\\n\\nHOGGLE disentangling himself from the hedge.\\n\\nSARAH: Got any more suggestions?\\n\\nBefore HOGGLE can answer they are interrupted by a terrible\\ngut-wrenching scream. It is positively unearthly. SARAH whirls around.\\n\\nSARAH: It sounds like it came from over there!\\n\\nHOGGLE points in the opposite direction.\\n\\nHOGGLE: Then let\\'s go this way.\\n\\nSARAH frowns at him as the scream begins again.\\n\\nSARAH: Hoggle! It sounds like someone\\'s being hurt!\\n\\nHOGGLE: Exactly why we should be headin\\' in the othermost direction!\\n\\nSARAH shakes her head in disgust and runs off as the screams become\\nmore unbearable.\\n\\nANOTHER ANGLE\\n\\nSARAH, running through the hedge maze. Driven by the sound of the\\nscreams, she has an unconscious ability to find her way through.\\nHOGGLE, trying to keep up with her, keeps running into dead ends.\\n\\nANOTHER ANGLE\\n\\nSARAH emerging from the maze. She is stopped in her tracks by what\\nshe sees and quickly covers her mouth to prevent herself from\\nscreaming. HOGGLE emerges a moment later, barely pauses before he\\nheads right back into the maze.\\n\\n40\\tEXT: CLEARING - DAY\\n\\nSARAH\\'S POV - FOUR GOBLINS are torturing a huge creature (LUDO) that\\nthey have hung by his ankle from a tree limb. They have also taken\\npains to bind the CREATURE, who it is obvious could take an most of\\nthem and win in a fairer fight. He is about nine feet tall,\\npowerfully built, and his screams of frustrated agony are truly\\nunbearable. The GOBLINS have devised a unique method of harassing\\nhim. They ALL carry long sticks which have small, fierce, biting\\nCREATURES on the end of them. The GOBLINS bat their sticks at LUDO,\\nwho bellows and tries to swat back. Since he is tied, the NIPPERS are\\nfree to bite him whenever they get near.\\n\\nANOTHER ANGLE\\n\\nSARAH, distraught, peeking out from behind a hedge.\\n\\nSARAH: The poor thing!\\n\\nHOGGLE peeks out from behind SARAH, then quickly ducks back. SARAH\\nlooks for a way to stop the torture. She picks up a rock and\\ncarefully aims it at the nearest GOBLIN. It hits his head and knocks\\nhis helmet visor over his eyes. Blinded, the GOBLIN lurches around,\\nswinging his nipper stick at the OTHER THREE.\\n\\nBLINDED GOBLIN: Hey! Who turned out the lights?\\n\\nThe OTHER GOBLINS see a new target and poke their nipper sticks\\ntowards him. He takes off and runs blindly into the hedge maze. The\\nOTHER THREE chase him, carrying the nipper sticks upright no that WE\\nCAN SEE their progress in the BG.\\n\\nANOTHER ANGLE\\n\\nSARAH desperately tries to untie the huge knot that holds LUDO\\nsuspended upside down. She can\\'t undo it and yells for HOGGLE\\n\\nSARAH: Get out here, you coward!\\n\\nHOGGLE appears from behind his hedge. He hesitates, then pulls a\\ndagger from his belt and joins SARAH. He cuts through the rope in one\\nhack, and LUDO falls to the ground with a thud.\\n\\nANOTHER ANGLE\\n\\nThe nipper sticks start yammering away as they see SARAH and HOGGLE\\nfreeing LUDO over the top of the hedge. The GOBLIN chase stops and\\nthey head back to the clearing. HOGGLE dives for the bushes but a\\ndetermined SARAH stays and pulls off the ropes. When LUDO is free, he\\npicks up a huge log. As the FOUR GOBLINS come roaring back into the\\nclearing, LUDO waves the log over his head. The GOBLIN charge\\nimmediately shifts into a GOBLIN retreat, the nipper sticks yipping\\nin fear.\\n\\nANOTHER ANGLE\\n\\nLUDO puts down the log and sits, his big shaggy head hanging down. He\\ntaken one hand and wipes away a tear.\\n\\nLUDO: Ludo ... hurt.\\n\\nSARAH\\'s heart breaks. This thing is the ultimate stuffed animal.\\n\\nSARAH: Is that your name? Ludo?\\n\\nHe nods and wipes away another tear.\\n\\nLUDO: Goblins ... mean to Ludo.\\n\\nSARAH: Oh, I know! They were terribly mean to you. (she moves closer\\nand pats his arm) But it\\'s all right now.\\n\\nLUDO sniffs and then breaks into the most endearing big dumb smile\\nyou have ever seen.\\n\\nLUDO: Friend!\\n\\nSARAH: That\\'s right, Ludo! I\\'m your friend. I\\'m Sarah.\\n\\nLUDO: Sarah ... friend!\\n\\nHOGGLE has come out from hiding during this exchange. He finds the\\nwhole scene a bit nauseating. And an unnecessary nuisance. If there\\'s\\none thing he doesn\\'t want, it\\'s competition for SARAH.\\n\\nHOGGLE: I think I\\'m about ta be sick.\\n\\nThey ignore him and LUDO grins for all he\\'s worth as SARAH beams up\\nat him. HOGGLE pulls her over to one side.\\n\\nHOGGLE: I hope yer not thinkin\\' o\\' lettin\\' the beast traipse along,\\nMissy. He\\'ll just slow us up.\\n\\nSARAH: Are you kidding?! He\\'ll be a great help! The goblins are\\nscared of him because he\\'s so fierce ...\\n\\nJust then LUDO shyly offers SARAH a flower that he has just picked\\nfor her. She takes it and smiles at him.\\n\\nHOGGLE (sarcastically): I sees what ya mean.\\n\\nSARAH shrugs and gives LUDO a pat. HOGGLE sighs with frustration.\\n\\nHOGGLE: I just thinks we was doin\\' fine on our own.\\n\\nSARAH: And we can do even better with Ludo. (turns to Ludo) You want\\nto help me save my baby brother, don\\'t you, Ludo?\\n\\nLUDO: Save ... baby. Good!\\n\\nSARAH nods with satisfaction and strides into the hedge maze. LUDO\\nright behind her. HOGGLE follows, clearly unhappy.\\n\\n41\\tEXT: FOREST GATE - DAY\\n\\nSARAH, HOGGLE and LUDO come out of the hedge maze and see a wall with\\ntwo SARAH-sized doors in it.\\n\\nHOGGLE: This is it, the entrance ta the Forbidden Forest. All we\\ngotta do is pick a door ...\\n\\nSARAH: What difference does it make? Let\\'s just go!\\n\\nLUDO quickly steps between SARAH and the doors.\\n\\nLUDO: One door ... good. One door ... bad.\\n\\nHOGGLE: Well, that\\'s great news. (to Ludo) Don\\'t suppose ya know\\nwhich is which?\\n\\nSARAH skirts around LUDO and goes up to the doors for a closer look\\nat them.\\n\\nLUDO: One door ... good. One door ...\\n\\nHOGGLE: All right, ya walkin\\' mountain! Ya made ya point.\\n\\nANOTHER ANGLE\\n\\nSARAH ignores the bickering behind her and examines the doors. Each\\none has a door knocker on it. Both knockers are carved into faces,\\nexcept one has the ring going through its ears and the other has it\\nstuck in its mouth.\\n\\nSARAH (to herself): I guess once you choose a door ... all you have\\nto do is knock.\\n\\nThe KNOCKER with the ring through its ears speaks.\\n\\nKNOCKER 1: Are you addressing me?\\n\\nSARAH jumps back, stunned.\\n\\nSARAH: You can talk!\\n\\nKNOCKER 1: What? What? You\\'ll have to speak up!!\\n\\nKNOCKER 2: mmffn ... grnth ... sminvl ...\\n\\nSARAH turns to the OTHER KNOCKER.\\n\\nSARAH: You too!\\n\\nKNOCKER 2: ... gmft ... bmble ...\\n\\nSARAH shakes her head in amazement.\\n\\nANOTHER ANGLE\\n\\nThe BOYS are still at it.\\n\\nHOGGLE: If yer so smart why not show us another way inta the forest?\\n\\nLUDO: Ludo ... not ... know.\\n\\nHOGGLE: That figures, don\\'t it? (he turns his back on Ludo, fuming)\\nWhy the Missy wants an overgrown hill o\\' hair fer a friend is beyond\\nme.\\n\\nLUDO tries to make HOGGLE feel better and pats him on the shoulder.\\nHOGGLE shakes his hand off with a growl.\\n\\nANOTHER ANGLE\\n\\nSARAH is excited.\\n\\nSARAH: I love it! Talking doors!! (to Knocker 1) Are you the right\\ndoor to the forest?\\n\\nKNOCKER 1: It doesn\\'t do to ask me. For some reason I can\\'t hear a\\nthing.\\n\\nSARAH turns to KNOCKER 1.\\n\\nKNOCKER 1: No use asking him, either. All he does is mumble.\\n\\nKNOCKER 2 gets very excited.\\n\\nKNOCKER 2: thgt ... vrnf ... lcl ...\\n\\nSARAH: I get it! You can\\'t talk with that ring in your mouth!\\n\\nShe removes the ring and looks at the FACE triumphantly.\\n\\nSARAH: Now, tell me which one of you is the right door to the forest.\\n\\nKNOCKER 2: Oh, I am. No question about it.\\n\\nSARAH: Great! How do we get you to open up?\\n\\nKNOCKER 2: One merely has to knock.\\n\\nSARAH: Of course, why didn\\'t I think of that.\\n\\nShe tries to get the ring back in its mouth.\\n\\nKNOCKER 2: Oh no you don\\'t, young lady! I\\'ve had just about enough of\\nthat awful thing, thank you very much!\\n\\nSARAH: But how are we supposed to get through this door if you won\\'t\\nlet me knock on it?\\n\\nKNOCKER 2: Well, I really couldn\\'t say now, could I?\\n\\nSARAH throws up her hands in disgust.\\n\\nKNOCKER 1: Oh do speak up, both of you? I can\\'t hear a thing!\\n\\nANOTHER ANGLE\\n\\nHOGGLE and LUDO are still at it.\\n\\nHOGGLE (conspiratorially): Ya know ... even if she does get the door\\nopen, ya won\\'t be able ta fit through. Why not make it easy on us all\\nand take a hike?\\n\\nLUDO: Ludo ... Stay!\\n\\nHOGGLE is disgusted.\\n\\nHOGGLE: Yer quite the speechifier, ain\\'t ya?\\n\\nANOTHER ANGLE\\n\\nSARAH suddenly gives KNOCKER 2 an evil grin.\\n\\nSARAH: Are you sure there isn\\'t anything I can do to change your mind?\\n\\nKNOCKER 2: Absolutely not! My lips are sealed!\\n\\nSARAH: That\\'s what I thought!\\n\\nThe KNOCKER presses its lips firmly together. SARAH deftly squeezes\\nits nose shut. It sputters for air and finally has to open its mouth\\nbefore it suffocates. SARAH shoves the ring in with a gleeful cry of\\ntriumph. She knocks, and the door swings open.\\n\\nSARAH: Let\\'s go!\\n\\nShe goes through the door and HOGGLE and LUDO race to follow. They\\nBOTH try to get through the door at the same time and get into such a\\ntangle that the door closes before they can straighten themselves out.\\n\\nHOGGLE: Now you\\'ve done it!\\n\\nIn a frenzy, HOGGLE starts banging on both doors.\\n\\nHOGGLE: Missy! Missy, wait!\\n\\n42\\tEXT: FORBIDDEN FOREST - DAY\\n\\nSARAH on the other side of the door. Except on this side, there is no\\ndoor, just a long expanse of wall. The forest is very dark, and as\\nits name suggests, very forbidding. SARAH can hear HOGGLE calling,\\nbut it is very faint.\\n\\nSARAH (scared): Hoggle?\\n\\n43\\tEXT: FOREST GATE - DAY\\n\\nHOGGLE is beating on the doors with such a frenzy that the other door\\nswings open.\\n\\nHOGGLE: I\\'m coming ...\\n\\nHe rushes through the door and disappears. We can tell from his voice\\nthat he is falling down a deep hole.\\n\\nHOGGLE (echoed): ... Miiiiiiiiissy!\\n\\nWe hear a huge splash. Then that door shuts and LUDO is all alone.\\n\\nLUDO: Sarah ... gone. Hoggle ... gone.\\n\\nHe is sad and confused. A FIGURE emerges from the hedge maze and\\nbegins to walk along the wall, away from LUDO. It is the WISE ONE.\\nLUDO brightens and chases after them.\\n\\nLUDO: Wait!\\n\\nThe WISE ONE stops and the HAT looks LUDO up and down.\\n\\nHAT: This ought to be a good one!\\n\\nLUDO: Ludo ... need ... door!\\n\\nWISE ONE: You have need of a door, do you? Ah, yes. A very useful\\nthing, the door; also known as a portal or threshold -- and that\\nwhich gives access, a gate or gangway ...\\n\\nHe continues walking and LUDO walks with him, listening intently.\\n\\nWISE ONE: ... also an entrance or entry, often accompanied by a\\npropylaeum ...\\n\\nHAT (sighs): If only I had hands I could cover my ears ... that is,\\nif I had ears ...\\n\\nWISE ONE: ... not to be confused with a window, or fenestration ...\\n\\n44\\tEXT: FOREST - DAY\\n\\nSARAH has waited long enough.\\n\\nSARAH: Hoggle, Ludo ... where are you?\\n\\nShe reaches into her pocket and looks at the watch. The hour hand is\\non the 7.\\n\\nSARAH: (whispers) Oh, Freddie! (she shoves the watch back into her\\npocket) Well, you guys are going to have to catch up with me \\'cause I\\ncan\\'t wait.\\n\\nThen determined, she strides off.\\n\\n45.\\tINT: HOLE - DAY\\n\\nHOGGLE is in a pool at the bottom of a deep hole in the ground. There\\nis a ledge just above him and he splashes violently trying to reach it.\\n\\nHOGGLE: Somebody help me! I can\\'t swim!\\n\\n46\\tEXT: FOREST - DAY\\n\\nSARAH is in a very thick, creepy part of the woods. She is clearly\\nlost. She gets herself tangled in a thorn bush, and struggles with it\\nto get herself free. Finally she does, and then, frustrated, sits\\ndown on the ground.\\n\\nSARAH: Why does everything have to happen to me?\\n\\nBut there\\'s no time to think about that because she hears the sound\\nof a driving drum rhythm and then a wild-looking, spindly, leering\\nLITTLE CREATURE comes scampering through the trees and into the\\nclearing; and then ANOTHER, and ANOTHER and ANOTHER. SARAH is\\nterrified as they approach her, but then not so terrified because the\\nCREATURES aren\\'t doing anything except dancing; wild, loose-limbed,\\nfrenzied dancing. SARAH laughs, and can\\'t help but be taken in by the\\nwild spectacle. And then they begin to encircle her, still moving to\\nthe wild rhythm.\\n\\nSARAH (laughing, moving): What are you?\\n\\nWILD THING 1: We\\'re Wild Things, baby! Wild!\\n\\nWILD THING 2: Wild and free!\\n\\nWILD THING 3: Get down!\\n\\nAnd then more WILD THINGS appear, and these produce instruments. As\\nand turn the drum rhythm into a frenzied upbeat number.\\n\\nWILD THING 1: You call that wild! I\\'ll show you wild!\\n\\nAnd then he does an amazing thing, to say the least. He takes his\\nhead off and rolls it along his arms from hand to hand like a\\njuggler, then tosses it high in the air and deftly catches it on his\\nshoulders. SARAH gasps and tries to get sway but another WILD THING\\npushes her back into the middle of the melee.\\n\\nWILD THING 2: Cut me some slack and move on back!\\n\\nAnd they do, and, moving to the pounding rhythm, he takes his eyes\\nout of his head and waves them at SARAH. He then tosses them on the\\nground as if they were a pair of dice. They land at SARAH\\'s feet\\nlooking straight up.\\n\\nWILD THING 2: Snake eyes!\\n\\nSARAH is fascinated and repelled. And the beat gets hotter and the\\nfrenzy more frenzied and she can\\'t help getting a little wild\\nherself. She begins to really dance.\\n\\nWILD THING 3: That\\'s it, baby, get wild and free! But you\\'ll never be\\nas wild as me!\\n\\nAnd to prove it he takes his head off and begins to dribble it like a\\nbasketball. WILD THING 1 leans over to SARAH and whispers\\nconspiratorily.\\n\\nWILD THING 1: I wouldn\\'t call that really _wild_, would you?\\n\\nSARAH: Well, it\\'s ... uh ... sort of ...\\n\\nWILD THING 1: I\\'d call _this_ wild ...\\n\\nAnd he takes off his head, puts it on the ground as if it were a golf\\nball, and then removes a leg and uses it as a golf club. The head\\ngoes flying, right to SARAH. SARAH catches the head, then tries to\\nget it back to its body but the body dances into the middle of all\\nthe other WILD THINGS and she can\\'t find it. So there\\'s SARAH,\\nrunning around like a chicken with two heads when suddenly the ears\\nstart to flap and the head flies out of her hand. A WILD THING grabs\\nher hand and turns her around.\\n\\nWILD THING 2: That was _wild_, baby. (he starts to dance) Now how\\n\\'bout gettin\\' wild with me?\\n\\nBut SARAH has had enough.\\n\\nSARAH: I think I\\'ll sit this one out ...\\n\\nWILD THING 1: Not with us you don\\'t ...\\n\\nWILD THING 2: \\'Cause we\\'re _wild_!\\n\\nAnd then they\\'re all over her, like a bunch of hyper puppies, and\\nit\\'s really too much.\\n\\nSARAH: Enough! I\\'ve got to find the castle!\\n\\nWILD THING 2: Well, why didn\\'t you say so, baby!\\n\\nWILD THING 3: That\\'s a _wild_ idea!\\n\\nAnd then his head flies off and he has to quickly grab it and put it\\nback and meanwhile the OTHERS start pushing and pulling on SARAH and\\npropel her into the woods.\\n\\nWILD THING 1: They got some wild goings on at the castle, baby!\\n\\n47\\tINT: HOLE - DAY\\n\\nHOGGLE is holding on to the ledge with his fingertips. He doesn\\'t\\nhave the strength to hold on much longer and he looks down at the\\nwater in mortal terror. He begins to slip just as a door opens in the\\nsheer rock and JARETH enters, accompanied by GOBLINS.\\n\\nJARETH: Well, what have we here ... if it isn\\'t little _Piggle_!\\n\\nHOGGLE screams and slips into the water. He tries to struggle back to\\nthe ledge but the GOBLINS push at him with poles, laughing maniacally.\\n\\nJARETH: Did the girl decide she doesn\\'t need you, now that she has\\nthat beast?\\n\\nHOGGLE (angry): She wouldn\\'t do nuthin\\' like that!\\n\\nJARETH leans over the water, laughing.\\n\\nJARETH: Don\\'t you know she could never care for a repulsive thing\\nlike you!\\n\\nHOGGLE splashes and tries to stay afloat.\\n\\nHOGGLE: She does care! Me \\'n Sarah is friends!\\n\\nJARETH: Only until something better comes along ... and I\\'ve\\ndefinitely got something better in mind!\\n\\nHOGGLE: Don\\'t you hurt her!\\n\\nHOGGLE grabs on to the ledge and the gleeful GOBLINS push him back\\ndown into the water.\\n\\nJARETH: What I do to her is my business ... and it is _inevitable_.\\n\\nHe grabs HOGGLE by the shirt front and lifts him out of the water.\\n\\nJARETH: You can be with me or against me.\\n\\nHOGGLE (terrified): Wh ... what do I gotta do?\\n\\nJARETH: I doubt if she can make it to the castle in time ...\\n\\nHe leans down and speaks directly into HOGGLE\\'s face.\\n\\nJARETH: But just in case, I want you to deliver her to me.\\n\\nHOGGLE: Never! I\\'d rather die!\\n\\nJARETH sneers scornfully.\\n\\nJARETH: Then so you shall.\\n\\nHe drops HOGGLE back into the water. The GOBLINS shriek with delight.\\nHOGGLE goes under and comes up sputtering.\\n\\nHOGGLE: Wait!\\n\\nJARETH was about to leave. He turns back to HOGGLE, a look of\\namusement on his face.\\n\\nHOGGLE: I gotta know what ... what you\\'ll do to her!\\n\\nHe splashes pathetically in a desperate attempt to stay above water.\\n\\nJARETH: I will do what ever amuses me ...\\n\\nHe reaches into his cloak and brings out a perfect peach.\\n\\nJARETH: All _you_ have to do is give her this.\\n\\nHe tosses HOGGLE the peach. HOGGLE catches it and immediately the\\nwater starts to recede.\\n\\nJARETH: You\\'ve made a very wise decision.\\n\\nHe leaves, followed by the GOBLINS.\\n\\nHOGGLE: I didn\\'t decide nuthin\\'!\\n\\nHOGGLE stares forlornly at the peach, and soon the water is gone and\\nhe is sitting on cold, damp ground.\\n\\n48\\tEXT: FOREST - DAY\\n\\nThe WILD THINGS are leading SARAH on a rocky path. She stumbles along\\nbut they couldn\\'t care less.\\n\\nSARAH: Are you sure this is the way to the castle?\\n\\nWILD THING 1: Oh, did you say \"the castle\"?\\n\\nWILD THING 2: I thought she said hassle!\\n\\nWILD THING 3: I thought she said rassle!\\n\\nWILD THING 1: Rassle! That\\'s a _wild_ idea!\\n\\nHe leaps on SARAH and she flings him off.\\n\\nSARAH: OK, guys, fun\\'s over.\\n\\nShe starts to leave and they pull her back.\\n\\nWILD THING 2: Over! It\\'s just begun!\\n\\nAnd then the musicians are back and the dancing gets wilder than\\never. The WILD THINGS totally surround SARAH, and though they aren\\'t\\nhurting her, they are definitely not letting her out. What they do is\\nstart throwing their heads at each other and switching them.\\n\\nWILD THINGS 1, 2 & 3: Now this is _really_ wild!\\n\\nANOTHER ANGLE\\n\\nA door opens in a nearby boulder and LUDO appears. In the background\\nWE CAN SEE and hear the WISE ONE as he wanders off.\\n\\nWISE ONE: ... very often preceded by a porch, or portico, also\\nverandah, and followed by a vestibule, otherwise known as an\\nantechamber or foyer ...\\n\\nHAT: Why me?!!\\n\\nThe door closes. LUDO sees SARAH in the middle of this weirdness and\\nis just a bit confused. SARAH sees him amidst the flying heads and\\ncries out in relief.\\n\\nSARAH: Ludo!\\n\\nLUDO: Sarah ... not ... want ... castle?\\n\\nSARAH: Are you kidding?!! Get me out of here!!!\\n\\nLUDO approaches the WILD THINGS and grabs a head before it reaches\\nits target and calmly tosses it into the trees.\\n\\nWILD THING 3: Hey, big fella! That\\'s a little _too_ wild ...\\n\\nBut there\\'s no time to talk because LUDO calmly catches the other\\nheads and tosses them away. The bodies go scurrying after their\\nheads, followed by the MUSICIANS. SARAH is free.\\n\\nSARAH: Oh, Ludo! I\\'m so glad you\\'re here!\\n\\nShe gives him a kiss and he beams.\\n\\nSARAH: Where\\'s Hoggle?\\n\\nLUDO: Hoggle ... in ... bad ... door.\\n\\nSARAH: We\\'ve got to find him! Do you think we can?\\n\\nLUDO is very confident. He spent a lot of time with the WISE ONE.\\n\\nLUDO: Ludo ... knows ... doors ...\\n\\nHe ambles off with SARAH following.\\n\\nLUDO: also ... portal ... or entrance ...\\n\\n49\\tINT: HOLE - DAY\\n\\nHOGGLE is more depressed than ever. The peach is nowhere to be seen.\\nSuddenly LUDO\\'s head appears above.\\n\\nLUDO: Hoggle ... all ... wet.\\n\\nHOGGLE almost jumps out of his skin and then is totally outraged.\\n\\nHOGGLE: Ain\\'t that the clever observation, ya feeble excuse fer a\\nthinkin\\' creature!\\n\\nSARAH appears from behind LUDO.\\n\\nSARAH: Be nice, Hoggle. Or we won\\'t get you out.\\n\\nHOGGLE\\'s face lights up and all thoughts of anger are forgotten.\\n\\nHOGGLE: Missy!\\n\\n50\\tINT: FOREST - DAY\\n\\nSARAH, HOGGLE and LUDO march through thick, overgrown forest. They do\\nnot know that they are being spied on by JARETH\\'S GOBLINS.\\n\\n51\\tINT: CLEARING - DAY\\n\\nThe THREESOME emerge into a clearing and see that they have come to a\\nwide fissure that goes off in either direction as far as the eye can\\nsee. It is spanned by a rickety bridge held by two thick wooden posts\\non either side of the gap. SARAH eyes the bridge warily.\\n\\nSARAH: It doesn\\'t look too strong but we don\\'t have much choice ...\\n\\nSuddenly they are interrupted by a high-pitched, but powerful voice.\\n\\nVOICE (VO): Halt! Halt or be slain forthwith!\\n\\nAt first they don\\'t see a thing and look around for the source of the\\nvoice. Then, the imposing 18 inch high figure of DIDYMUS, resplendent\\nin rakish hat and swashbuckling sword, emerges from behind one of the\\nposts and stands in front of the bridge. LUDO and SARAH are\\ndumbstruck. HOGGLE, however, is not at a loss for words.\\n\\nHOGGLE: Out of our way, ya wretched little rodent ...\\n\\nDIDYMUS looks directly at HOGGLE.\\n\\nDIDYMUS: You, sir, shall be the first to feel the point of my sword!\\n\\nHOGGLE snorts with derision and SARAH tries a more sensible approach.\\n\\nSARAH: Please, we really have to cross this bridge. It\\'s a matter of\\nlife and death!\\n\\nDIDYMUS shrugs elegantly.\\n\\nDIDYMUS: Under any other circumstances I would hasten to oblige you,\\nfair damsel, for your mission sounds a worthy one.\\n\\nSARAH: Oh, it is!\\n\\nDIDYMUS: But I am sworn. Without my permission, none may pass.\\n\\nSARAH throws up her hands and HOGGLE mumbles under his breath. It\\nappears to be up to LUDO to break the deadlock. He lifts DIDYMUS up\\ninto the air and moves him to one side. They then start to walk\\ntoward the bridge and DIDYMUS chases them, brandishing his sword.\\n\\nDIDYMUS: You dishonor me, varlets! En garde!\\n\\nTo his chagrin they ignore him and keep walking.\\n\\nDIDYMUS: Rapscallions! Duel ... or _die_!\\n\\nThis gets their attention and they turn to look at him, annoyed.\\n\\nHOGGLE: What _is_ this weasel babblin\\' about?\\n\\nIt is too much for DIDYMUS. He flings himself at HOGGLE with a mighty\\nwar cry. HOGGLE tries to run for it but DIDYMUS is right behind him,\\nadministering more than a few pinpricks in embarrassing places.\\nHOGGLE dives behind a bush and DIDYMUS sniffs at his cowardice. He\\ncomes back and faces LUDO.\\n\\nDIDYMUS: It is you I want, rogue of rogues. You who dealt me the\\ngravest affront!\\n\\nAnd with that he jabs LUDO in the foot! LUDO is stunned, and howling,\\nbegins to hop on his good foot. DIDYMUS, his head thrown back for a\\ntriumphant yell, goes after LUDO with his sword flashing and there is\\nnothing for LUDO to do but pick up a branch and defend himself. It is\\nthe most mismatched duel in the history of chivalrous absurdity\\nDIDYMUS moving at an incredible speed, parrying the mighty swipes of\\nLUDO\\'s branch with great skill -- and no small amount of difficulty.\\nAnd LUDO fending off the incessant pinpricks of the little sword,\\nleaping about with surprising agility -- and at a rate that exhausts\\nhim totally. Finally, the two of them, breathing heavily, lower their\\nweapons. And, to everyone\\'s surprise, DIDYMUS throws down his sword.\\n\\nDIDYMUS: I no longer wish to slay you, for you are a truly noble\\nknight.\\n\\nThen DIDYMUS strides up to him and, craning his neck, attempts to\\nlook LUDO in the eyes.\\n\\nDIDYMUS: Destroy me if you will.\\n\\nLUDO quickly drops his branch in response. The whole thing has upset\\nhis gentle nature terribly. DIDYMUS then holds out a tiny paw.\\n\\nDIDYMUS: Never have I met my match in battle, yet you, noble knight,\\nhave fought me to a standstill.\\n\\nLUDO kneels and tentatively takes DIDYMUS\\' paw into his own huge hand.\\n\\nDIDYMUS: Let us be brothers henceforth, and fight for the right as\\none!\\n\\nSARAH cheers and HOGGLE, unimpressed, rubs his sore rear. LUDO\\nsmiles from ear to ear.\\n\\nLUDO: Ludo ... get ... brother!\\n\\nThen he and DIDYMUS exchange the ritual kiss on each cheek, which in\\ntheir case is not easily accomplished. SARAH then turns practical.\\n\\nSARAH: Well, now that that\\'s settled let\\'s get going.\\n\\nShe heads for the bridge but DIDYMUS blocks her way.\\n\\nDIDYMUS: You forget my sacred vow, my lady. I cannot let you pass.\\n\\nSARAH is incensed.\\n\\nSARAH: But you said Ludo was your brother! How can you refuse him?!!\\n\\nDIDYMUS: I have taken an oath. I must defend it to the death.\\n\\nHOGGLE, enraged, turns on LUDO.\\n\\nHOGGLE: Some brother he turned out ta be!\\n\\nLUDO: Brother ... good!\\n\\nHOGGLE: Well, if he\\'s so good, why won\\'t he let us get on with our\\nbusiness?\\n\\nLUDO scratches his head. He has no idea. SARAH sits down beside the\\ncrestfallen DIDYMUS.\\n\\nSARAH: OK, let\\'s handle this thing logically. What exactly have you\\nsworn?\\n\\nDIDYMUS brandishes his sword.\\n\\nDIDYMUS: I have sworn with my life-blood, no one shall pass this way\\nwithout my permission.\\n\\nSARAH: Then may we ... _have your permission_?\\n\\nDIDYMUS is stunned. HOGGLE and LUDO barely breathe. Slowly DIDYMUS\\nlooks all around and then, with a courage greater than any he has\\never had to call on before, he says it.\\n\\nDIDYMUS: Yes.\\n\\nAnd the sky doesn\\'t fall, and the earth doesn\\'t heave, and everything\\nis exactly as it should be.\\n\\nSARAH: Thank you.\\n\\nDIDYMUS breathes a sigh of relief and steps aside to let them pass.\\nLUDO is the first one to go over and that is unfortunate. Because the\\nrickety bridge collapses under his weight. SARAH and HOGGLE jump back\\non the ground near DIDYMUS just in time and poor LUDO swings over the\\ndeep fissure, hanging on to one of the ropes that held the bridge.\\nWith a mighty effort he hoists himself up on to the opposite side and\\nlooks forlornly over at the others.\\n\\nSARAH: Oh no!\\n\\nSARAH crumples to the ground, and stares miserably at the broken\\nbridge.\\n\\nHOGGLE: Now see what ya done, ya mush-brained mammoth!\\n\\nDIDYMUS: I, Sir Didymus, take responsibility for the actions of my\\nbrother, my lady. Lash out at me if you must.\\n\\nSARAH: I\\'m not mad at Ludo, Sir Didymus. I\\'m just upset because time\\nis running out and I have to rescue my baby brother.\\n\\nDIDYMUS is struck to the very roots of his chivalry.\\n\\nDIDYMUS: You mean to rescue _a child_?!!\\n\\nSARAH: The goblin king took him, and I\\'ve only got ...\\n\\nShe takes out the watch. The hour hand is on the 5.\\n\\nSARAH: ... five hours to get him back.\\n\\nDIDYMUS yells across to LUDO.\\n\\nDIDYMUS: Is this your quest, too, my brother?\\n\\nLUDO: Save ... baby.\\n\\nDIDYMUS is overwhelmed.\\n\\nDIDYMUS: Then I shall join you, lady. I am at your service, upon my\\nsword.\\n\\nHe bows low before SARAH and she smiles.\\n\\nSARAH: I happily accept your fealty, Sir Didymus.\\n\\nHOGGLE frowns with displeasure at this latest development.\\n\\nHOGGLE: This is all well an\\' good, Missy. But we still got one little\\nproblem.\\n\\nThey all look across the fissure at LUDO.\\n\\nLUDO: Ludo ... friends.\\n\\nHOGGLE: Yes, yes. We\\'re friends. Very nice. What\\'s that got ta do\\nwith us gettin\\' over there without a bridge?\\n\\nLUDO: Rocks ... friends.\\n\\nHOGGLE: We\\'re wastin\\' our time, Missy. Let\\'s you an\\' me go find\\nanother ...\\n\\nHe is interrupted by LUDO bellowing, which is followed by a\\nsympathetic rumbling. Suddenly rocks pile in from both directions\\nuntil there is a pile in the fissure high enough for them to walk\\nacross.\\n\\nLUDO: Rocks ... friends!\\n\\nSARAH (laughing): They sure are, Ludo!\\n\\nShe skips happily across followed by a sullen HOGGLE. DIDYMUS\\nwhistles and is quickly joined by a tail-wagging SHEEPDOG. SARAH\\ngasps, he is the spitting image of her own MERLIN.\\n\\nSARAH: It\\'s ...\\n\\nDIDYMUS: Ambrosius! My noble steed.\\n\\nSARAH laughs and shrugs. Nothing surprises her in the labyrinth.\\n\\n52\\tEXT: FOREST - NIGHT\\n\\nThe edge of the forest. From here you can see the castle in the\\ndistance, just across the dry, cracked plain. The sky is full of\\nstars. SARAH, HOGGLE, LUDO and DIDYMUS are sitting around a fire.\\n\\nDIDYMUS: What will you do after we save the child, my lady?\\n\\nSARAH: Take him home, of course! That is, if I can figure out how.\\n\\nDIDYMUS: What is your kingdom like? Do you have many knights to\\ndefend your honor?\\n\\nSARAH: Not even one.\\n\\nDIDYMUS: It cannot be! What bitter place is this that does such\\ndishonor to my lady?\\n\\nSARAH: It\\'s a place where ... where nobody really sees me.\\n\\nLUDO: Ludo ... see ... Sarah!\\n\\nSARAH: (laughs) I know you do, Ludo. (she turns to Didymus) And\\nthanks to you, Sir Didymus, I finally have a knight.\\n\\nHe bows graciously. HOGGLE, who has been watching this scene, feels\\nrejected and miserable. He gets up and wanders away from the fire.\\nAfter a moment, SARAH follows him.\\n\\nSARAH: Don\\'t you feel like resting?\\n\\nHOGGLE: I ain\\'t tired.\\n\\nSARAH: Me neither. What I am is hungry.\\n\\nHOGGLE winces but SARAH doesn\\'t notice. SARAH looks back at LUDO and\\nDIDYMUS. LUDO lies on his back snoring loudly. DIDYMUS dozes against\\nAMBROSIUS\\' side.\\n\\nSARAH: They\\'re both wonderful, aren\\'t they?\\n\\nHOGGLE: They\\'re alright.\\n\\nSARAH: They\\'re more than that! They\\'re loyal and strong ... and with\\ntheir help I\\'m going to beat Jareth!\\n\\nHOGGLE shakes his head sadly. SARAH speaks as an afterthought.\\n\\nSARAH: And yours, too, of course.\\n\\nHOGGLE: I ain\\'t no fighter ...\\n\\nShe shrugs that off and wanders away to look out at the castle.\\nHOGGLE goes through agony for a moment, and then makes a decision.\\n\\nHOGGLE: Missy ... if you\\'re hungry ...\\n\\nHe holds out the peach that JARETH gave him: the world\\'s most\\ndelicious looking peach.\\n\\nSARAH: Oh, great!\\n\\nShe happily taken the peach and bites. It takes everything HOGGLE has\\nto not put his hands over his ears. She takes another bite and then\\nstumbles.\\n\\nSARAH (laughing): Everything\\'s dancing ...\\n\\nShe looks up at the sky, exhilarated.\\n\\nSARAH: Even the stars are dancing!\\n\\nHOGGLE turns and walks back to the fire. SARAH stumbles about as she\\ngazes happily at the sky.\\n\\n53\\tINT: CASTLE - NIGHT\\n\\nFREDDIE is leading the GOBLINS on a merry chase. He crawls around the\\nroom, pulling things off shelves. A GOBLIN is on his hands and knees\\nin front of JARETH polishing his boots. JARETH kicks the GOBLIN and\\nsends him flying across the room. This makes FREDDIE laugh and he\\npulls a book off the shelf and throws it. It hits a GOBLIN on the\\nhead. JARETH scoops up FREDDIE and puts him in his cradle. He sits\\ndown next to him.\\n\\nJARETH: Little goblin-to-be, I have something to amuse you.\\n\\nHe waves his hands in front of FREDDIE and suddenly beautiful\\ncrystalline balls appear in them. He runs them over his fingers like\\nso many coins, their molten light so dazzling that FREDDIE kicks up\\nhis legs with excitement. And WE CAN SEE that at the end of his\\npajamas are two wizened goblin feet! JARETH laughs and flings the\\nballs into the air and they turn into bubbles, beautiful, mesmerizing\\nbubbles.\\n\\nJARETH: Soon, little one. Very, very soon ...\\n\\nAnd they both watch the bubbles as they fly out the window and over\\nthe labyrinth, coldly beautiful against the darkening sky.\\n\\n54\\tEXT: FOREST - NIGHT\\n\\nSARAH\\'s hand opens slowly and the half-eaten peach falls to the\\nground. She stares out into the sky, mesmerized. The bubbles are\\napproaching; dazzling, dancing bubbles. And then she hears music,\\nhaunting, spell-casting music. The bubbles come closer and WE CAN SEE\\nthat each one contains a TWIRLING DANCER, a DANCER just like the one\\nin SARAH\\'s music box. She gets up and follows them.\\n\\nANOTHER ANGLE\\n\\nHOGGLE watching from the woods.\\n\\nHOGGLE: Damn you, Jareth! (He turns and begins to walk away) And damn\\nme too!\\n\\nANOTHER ANGLE\\n\\nA bubble, with SARAH inside it, floating through the sky. She appears\\nenchanted, and she begins to twirl, just like the OTHER DANCERS.\\n\\n55\\tEXT: BALLROOM - NIGHT\\n\\nA giant bubble, with a magnificent ballroom inside it. Tiny bubbles\\nrush to join it. In one of them is SARAH.\\n\\n56\\tINT: BALLROOM - NIGHT\\n\\nThe music changes and now SARAH is inside the ballroom. It is a\\nmagnificent spectacle with all the beauty and decadence of an 18th\\nCentury Venetian ball. Magnificently dressed DANCERS swirl to the\\nmusic in an incredibly opulent setting. But when you look closer you\\nsense decay just beneath the surface; things are threadbare, faded.\\nThe GUESTS wear masks that are elegant parodies of goblin faces,\\ngiving them all a slightly sinister look. And there is something very\\nprovocative about all of them; the WOMEN have bare shoulders and\\ndaring decolletage, many of the MEN have their shirts open to the\\nwaist. Some of them lounge against the wall indolently and there is\\nthe feeling that the party has been going on all night. In this\\nsetting SARAH is the picture of innocence. TWO WOMEN snickering\\nbehind their fans as SARAH approaches, and she is suddenly terribly\\nself-conscious. How plain She feels amidst all this! She looks into\\none of the many mirrors that line the ballroom and sighs at her\\nimage. Then suddenly she sees something in the mirror that makes her\\ngasp.\\n\\nANOTHER ANGLE\\n\\nThe mirror, and in it the reflection of a resplendent JARETH dancing\\nwith a particularly exotic-looking WOMAN. SARAH whirls around, trying\\nto get another glimpse of JARETH. She is so intent on trying to see\\nhim that she doesn\\'t notice that she is being stared at brazenly by a\\nYOUNG MAN leaning against the wall. He moves next to her and whispers\\nsomething into her ear. She hurries away, shocked; and the YOUNG MAN\\nthrows back his head and laughs. And JARETH sees the whole thing.\\n\\nANOTHER ANGLE\\n\\nSARAH is approached by a MIDDLE-AGED MAN who has a box hanging at\\nwaist height from a ribbon around his neck. It looks like SARAH\\'s\\nmusic box. She looks down at it with interest and he throws open the\\ncover. But there is no dancer inside, instead there is a stick carved\\nlike a snake. It shoots out at SARAH and she cries out and backs\\naway. ALL THE PEOPLE around her laugh and she moves hurriedly on.\\nJARETH, who is dancing with an even more beautiful WOMAN than before,\\nwatches SARAH.\\n\\nANOTHER ANGLE\\n\\nSARAH is looking for JARETH. She spots him and sees him whisper\\nsomething to his partner who smiles knowingly from beneath her mask\\nand licks her lips. SARAH blushes and turns away and finds herself\\nlooking into another mirror. But in the reflection, JARETH isn\\'t with\\na partner. He is standing alone, the DANCERS a whirling blur around\\nhim, and he is looking straight at her. SARAH, whirling around to\\nface the crowd and she sees JARETH with yet a third BEAUTY. And then\\nshe realizes that it is herself! In a trance-like state she moves\\nthrough the CROWD to get a better look.\\n\\nANOTHER ANGLE\\n\\nSARAH\\'S POV - She is whirling in JARETH\\'s arms, and she is the most\\nbeautiful woman at the ball. JARETH smiles down at her and the\\nattraction between them is palpable.\\n\\nJARETH: You look like a queen.\\n\\nSARAH looks up at him, thrilled by his words.\\n\\nSARAH: I ... I feel like ... I ... don\\'t know what I feel ...\\n\\nJARETH (smiling): Don\\'t you?\\n\\nAnd he whirls her around dizzyingly, so dizzyingly that she swoons in\\nhis arms. He catches her before she can fall very far, tightening his\\ngrip around her waist.\\n\\nSARAH: Are we ... are we in a bubble?\\n\\nJARETH: Yes, we are. A dream bubble ... where your dreams can come\\ntrue.\\n\\nANOTHER ANGLE\\n\\nOUR SARAH is being jostled by the crowd. She stumbles and almost\\nfalls on top of a COUPLE on a bench. The WOMAN is sprawled across the\\nlap of the MAN who wears a mask with a very phallic nose. SARAH backs\\naway from them, frightened.\\n\\nANOTHER ANGLE\\n\\nJARETH and SARAH, dancing. She is smiling up at him, he has never\\nlooked more handsome. There is something more open about him, as if\\nhe, too, is caught up in the moment. He nuzzles her hair with his\\nlips and whispers in her ear.\\n\\nJARETH (whispering): My Queen!\\n\\nThen he begins a song. A song that tells SARAH he will give her\\neverything she wants, even things she doesn\\'t know she wants. A song\\nthat says forget it all; all the restrictions, all the powerlessness.\\nForget and stay in the dream.\\n\\nANOTHER ANGLE\\n\\nOUR SARAH watches, mesmerized. But every time she tries to get closer\\nto JARETH and SARAH she in jostled by a lascivious ADMIRER, pushed\\nout of the way by WOMEN laughingly being chased by MEN. She stumbles\\nagainst a wall and a door opens. Inside, pillow feathers are flying\\nand she can\\'t make out what the SEVERAL PEOPLE are doing. A WOMAN\\ncomes up to the doorway, winks at SARAH, and closes the door.\\n\\nANOTHER ANGLE\\n\\nJARETH finishes the song and SARAH looks up at him, smiling. He moves\\nhis face closer to hers and she closes her eyes. His face comes\\ncloser, and closer.\\n\\nANOTHER ANGLE\\n\\nOUR SARAH shrinks back from what she is seeing. She turns and runs,\\npushing herself though the languid CROWD, right into the bubble\\nitself.\\n\\n57\\tEXT: BALL - NIGHT\\n\\nSARAH comes crashing through the bubble and the whole ballroom\\ncrumbles. In seconds it resembles nothing so much as a junkyard.\\n\\n58\\tEXT JUNK CITY - NIGHT\\n\\nSARAH runs through the streets of a part-market, part-junkyard. There\\nare piles of rubble and junk everywhere, and between them are tents\\nfrom which PEOPLE hawk objects of all kinds. Some of them approach\\nSARAH and she pushes them away, sobbing.\\n\\nANOTHER ANGLE\\n\\nSARAH\\'S POV - A RED TENT, and standing in front of it is an OLD WOMAN\\nstooped over from the objects piled high on her back. She beckons to\\nSARAH and pulls the tent flap aside.\\n\\nJUNK WOMAN: \\'Ere it is, Dearie. All the fings you want, all the fings\\nyou need.\\n\\nANOTHER ANGLE\\n\\nThe flap opens wider and inside the tent WE CAN SEE SARAH\\'s room!\\n\\nANOTHER ANGLE\\n\\nSARAH gasps at the sight and runs headlong into the tent. She trips\\nover the threshold and lands face down on her bed.\\n\\n59\\tINT: SARAH\\'S ROOM - NIGHT\\n\\nSARAH sits up on the bed and looks around the room. She shakes her\\nhead and laughs.\\n\\nSARAH: What a dream!\\n\\nShe gets up and stretches, then walks over to the mirror. She smiles\\nat her reflection.\\n\\nSARAH: Yep, you\\'ve got quite an imagination, kid, Just what a great\\nactress needs.\\n\\nShe walks over to the bed and picks up Lancelot the bear.\\n\\nSARAH: How about a midnight snack, Sir Lance ...\\n\\nShe goes over to the door and opens it.\\n\\n60\\tEXT: JUNK CITY - NIGHT\\n\\nSARAH\\'S POV - THE MARKET/JUNKYARD TEEMING WITH ACTIVITY.\\nThe JUNK WOMAN peers in.\\n\\nJUNK WOMAN: \\'Aven\\'t you got everythin\\' you need, Dearie?\\n\\n61\\tINT: SARAH\\'S ROOM - NIGHT\\n\\nSARAH screams and slams the door. She buries her face in the bear.\\n\\nSARAH: It _is_ just a dream!\\n\\nShe takes a deep breath and goes to the door again. She opens it very\\nslowly.\\n\\n62\\tEXT: JUNK CITY - NIGHT\\n\\nSARAH\\'S POV - THE SAME TEEMING ACTIVITY. The JUNK WOMAN peers in\\nagain.\\n\\nJUNK WOMAN: Best to stay in there, where it\\'s safe, Dearie. Don\\'t\\nknow what might \\'appen to you out \\'ere.\\n\\n63\\tINT: SARAH\\'S ROOM - NIGHT\\n\\nSARAH clams the door again and rushes over to the window. A GROUP OF\\nREVELLERS peer in at her and laugh. She quickly pulls the curtains\\nclosed and walks back to the center of the room. She stands clutching\\nthe bear, then looks up at her reflection in the mirror.\\n\\nANOTHER ANGLE\\n\\nSARAH\\'S reflection. Herself as a very old woman, clutching a teddy\\nbear.\\n\\nOLD SARAH: Best to stay in here where it\\'s safe. Don\\'t know what\\nmight happen to you out there.\\n\\nSARAH steps back from the mirror and suddenly the floor becomes a sea\\nof mud and all the objects in the room come falling down on her. As\\nshe tries to rise out of the muck more objects land on and around her\\nand pull her down.\\n\\nSARAH: Help! Somebody help me!\\n\\n64\\tEXT: JUNK CITY - NIGHT\\n\\nLUDO and DIDYMUS desperately searching for SARAH, DIDYMUS riding his\\nDOG.\\n\\n65\\tINT: TAVERN TENT - NIGHT\\n\\nHOGGLE sits at a bar, drowning his sorrows. A JUNK MAN/BARTENDER\\nworks behind the bar. HOGGLE slams his cup down.\\n\\nHOGGLE: Another!\\n\\nThe BARTENDER holds out his hand greedily. HOGGLE pulls a treasure\\noff his belt and slams it on the bar. The BARTENDER pours.\\n\\n66\\tEXT: JUNK CITY - NIGHT\\n\\nDIDYMUS and LUDO approach the red tent. They spy the JUNK WOMAN.\\n\\nDIDYMUS: Did you see a noble maiden pass this way?\\n\\nJUNK WOMAN: A noble maiden, eh? What would she be doin\\' in a place\\nlike this?\\n\\nDIDYMUS: She\\'s on a rescue mission ...\\n\\nThe JUNK WOMAN finds this hilarious.\\n\\nJUNK WOMAN: A rescue mission, ha! You\\'re in the wrong place, for\\nsure! The only fings we cares about rescuin\\' around \\'ere is our\\nworldly goods!\\n\\nShe takes an oil lamp off her back and shines it on her sleeve for\\nemphasis.\\n\\n67\\tINT: SARAH\\'S ROOM - NIGHT\\n\\nSARAH is drowning in a sea of junk. She hears DIDYMUS and cries out\\nhopefully.\\n\\nSARAH: Didymus, in here! Help me!\\n\\nThe door opens and the JUNK WOMAN peers inside.\\n\\nJUNK WOMAN: Don\\'t worry, Dearie. I sent \\'im away!\\n\\nSARAH groans.\\n\\nJUNK WOMAN: Knew you wouldn\\'t want to be leavin\\' your nice fings for\\nno rescue mission.\\n\\nSARAH: Oh my god! Freddie!\\n\\nJUNK WOMAN: Freddie? Is that one of them dolls over there ... or that\\nnice teddy?\\n\\nSARAH struggles for the door in the sea of junk.\\n\\nSARAH: No! He\\'s my brother! And I\\'ve got to save him!\\n\\nShe continues pushing through the junk.\\n\\nJUNK WOMAN: No you don\\'t, Dearie. You can stay right \\'ere with all\\nyour pretty fings ...\\n\\nSARAH knows what her choice has to be.\\n\\nSARAH: I know I can. (joyous) But I don\\'t want to!\\n\\nShe lifts herself out of the junk with a mighty heave and stands in\\nthe doorway. She looks down at the JUNK WOMAN triumphantly.\\n\\nSARAH: Now get out of my way!\\n\\n68\\tEXT: JUNK CITY - NIGHT\\n\\nSARAH runs out of the tent, a look of triumph on her face.\\n\\nThe JUNK WOMAN pulls something off her own pile and holds it out to\\nSARAH.\\n\\nJUNK WOMAN: Wait, Dearie! Look at this!\\n\\nShe holds out SARAH\\'s music box, opens it, and the little DANCER\\ntwirls inside.\\n\\nSARAH (grinning): Keep it!\\n\\nAnd she is off. As SARAH goes the CAMERA LINGERS on the JUNK WOMAN.\\nAnd we begin to move around to her other side and even though we had\\njust seen her from all sides, we now see something very, very\\ndifferent. Where the other side of the woman should be WE SEE a\\ncross-section of her, with JARETH inside. His head is beneath the\\npile of junk and his hand is inside her head making it laugh. He is\\nthe puppeteer operating the JUNK LADY, as indeed, she has been\\noperated. JARETH is mad.\\n\\nJARETH: Damn.\\n\\n69\\tEXT: CASTLE GATE - NIGHT\\n\\nLUDO and DIDYMUS sit forlornly at the gate. SARAH appears out of the\\nnight.\\n\\nDIDYMUS: My lady!\\n\\nLUDO leaps to his feet.\\n\\nLUDO: Sarah ... safe!\\n\\nSARAH rushes into his arms.\\n\\nDIDYMUS: Is Hoggle not with you?\\n\\nSARAH pulls away from LUDO.\\n\\nSARAH: Hoggle made his choice, he\\'s ... not part of the mission\\nanymore.\\n\\nDIDYMUS (angry): The coward!\\n\\nLUDO: Hoggle ... good!\\n\\nSARAH shrugs, and smiles at him.\\n\\nSARAH: Maybe. But there\\'s no time to discuss it. We\\'ve got a baby to\\nrescue, remember!\\n\\nShe leads them through the gates.\\n\\n70\\tEXT: GOBLIN TOWN - NIGHT\\n\\nStreets full of hovels encircle the castle. This is where the GOBLINS\\nlive. As SARAH, LUDO and HOGGLE walk through the dark, eerie streets\\nthey are met by the slamming of shutters and the extinguishing of\\nlights.\\n\\nDIDYMUS: Methinks they are expecting us, my lady.\\n\\nA CHILD GOBLIN peers at them from an open doorway. A FEMALE GOBLIN\\nsees him and drags him inside and slams the door.\\n\\nSARAH (grimly): Methinks you\\'re right!\\n\\n71\\tINT: TAVERN - NIGHT\\n\\nHOGGLE is still at it. He pulls his belt off his body and WE SEE that\\nthe only treasure left is SARAH\\'s plastic circlet. He slowly pulls it\\noff and stares at it. The BARTENDER approaches, his eyes lighting up\\nat the eight of this treasure.\\n\\nBARTENDER: Another?\\n\\nHOGGLE hesitates, then hands the circlet over. The BARTENDER bites it\\nand his face lights up with glee.\\n\\nBARTENDER: Plastic!\\n\\nHe goes to get the drink and HOGGLE puts his face down on the bar and\\nsobs.\\n\\nANOTHER ANGLE\\n\\nAt the other end of the bar sits the WISE ONE. The HAT looks over at\\nHOGGLE and shakes his head knowingly.\\n\\nHAT: Drinkin\\' to forget, eh, buddy?\\n\\nHOGGLE looks up.\\n\\nWISE ONE: To forget, ah yes. To suffer a mental lapse, to obliterate\\nfrom one\\'s consciousness, to suffer amnesia, a blank or fugue, to\\ndrink the waters of Lethe ...\\n\\nHOGGLE (drunkenly): What\\'s Lethe ...\\n\\nWISE ONE: The waters of forgetfulness. They remove from our minds\\nwhat is too painful to remember ...\\n\\nHOGGLE looks thoughtfully at the drink in his hand.\\n\\nWISE ONE: ... but with the memory goes our wisdom, or knowledge, that\\nwhich brings us understanding, also enlightenment ...\\n\\nBut there is no one to continue benefitting from the WISE ONE\\'s\\npearls. HOGGLE is gone.\\n\\nHAT: You can cool it down there ... he\\'s gone ...\\n\\nWISE ONE: ... a grasp of things, a depth or profundity of thought ...\\n\\nThe HAT sighs and looks over at the BARTENDER who is still admiring\\nhis plastic treasure.\\n\\nHAT: Another one over here ... and make it a double ...\\n\\n72\\tEXT: GOBLIN TOWN - NIGHT\\n\\nSARAH, LUDO and DIDYMUS emerge into the vast courtyard outside the\\ncastle. It in eerily quiet. Too quiet.\\n\\nSARAH: We\\'re going to make it!\\n\\nDIDYMUS sniffs the air.\\n\\nDIDYMUS: I am less than sure ...\\n\\nThey are interrupted by a high-pitched shriek as a GOBLIN jumps on\\nLUDO\\'s back. Then the courtyard is filled with GOBLINS, what seems\\nlike the whole army, coming right at them. DIDYMUS fends off the\\nVANGUARD PARTY with his sword and LUDO punches out the ones that get\\nby him. DIDYMUS unswords a GOBLIN and his weapon goes flying. SARAH\\npicks it up and does some parrying of her own. But there are too many\\nof them. The threesome turn and run.\\n\\n73\\tINT: CASTLE - NIGHT\\n\\nJARETH stands by the window, watching the battle. The WHITE BIRD sits\\non his shoulder. JARETH looks over at FREDDIE who stands holding on\\nto the side of the cradle. JARETH smiles and turns back to the melee\\nbelow. The BIRD flies out the window.\\n\\n74\\tEXT: GOBLIN TOWN - NIGHT\\n\\nSARAH, LUDO and DIDYMUS race down the streets. The GOBLINS are in hot\\npursuit.\\n\\n75\\tEXT: STREET - NIGHT\\n\\nThey come careening around a corner and it seems that they have\\nescaped their pursuers. The sound of the GOBLINS seems to be getting\\nfarther away.\\n\\nSARAH: I think we lost them.\\n\\nThey turn and see that, unfortunately they have come full circle and\\nare right back in the courtyard. LUDO climbs part way up a wall and\\nlooks over the streets.\\n\\nDIDYMUS: What do you see, my brother?\\n\\nLUDO gulps. What he sees is the GOBLIN ARMY coming down every street\\nright towards them.\\n\\nLUDO: Ludo ... see ... trouble!\\n\\nAnd then the trouble arrives and SARAH and DIDYMUS are heavily into\\nswordplay. LUDO tries clumsily to get down and is tormented by\\nGOBLINS who prick at him with their spears. SARAH looks up and sees\\nhis predicament. She gets an idea.\\n\\nSARAH: Call the rocks, Ludo! Call the rocks!\\n\\nLUDO makes a heroic effort and gets to the top of the wall.\\n\\nHe then throws his head back and bellows.\\n\\n76\\tEXT: GOBLIN TOWN - NIGHT\\n\\nAn enormous rumbling is heard and soon the streets are filled with\\nboulders, all careening towards LUDO. They knock GOBLINS out of their\\npath like so many bowling pins.\\n\\n77\\tEXT: COURTYARD - NIGHT\\n\\nSARAH and DIDYMUS fight bravely. LUDO keeps bellowing and throwing\\noff the occasional GOBLIN that is stupid enough to jump on him. Soon\\nthe rocks reach the courtyard and form a barrier between the\\nTHREESOME and their ATTACKERS. LUDO reaches down and lifts SARAH and\\nDIDYMUS on to the wall. They jump and disappear into the castle\\nenclave.\\n\\n78\\tINT: CASTLE - NIGHT\\n\\nA door opens in a dark part of the castle. LUDO, SARAH and DIDYMUS\\nenter. They look around and quickly tip-toe down a dark corridor.\\nThey turn a corner and see some GOBLINS marching their way. They duck\\nout of sight.\\n\\n79\\tEXT: CASTLE - NIGHT\\n\\nThe main entrance to the castle. TWO-GOBLIN GUARDS stand outside the\\nlarge wooden doors. The results of the THREESOME\\'s escape can be\\nheard in the distance. A FIGURE staggers out of the dark, singing\\ndrunkenly. It is HOGGLE.\\n\\nHOGGLE: \" ... it\\'s so cold in the night with no gold to keep me warm\\n... \"\\n\\nHe trips over his feet as he approaches the GUARD.\\n\\nGUARD: Who goes there?\\n\\nHOGGLE \" ... so cold, oh so cold ... \"\\n\\nGUARD 2: Don\\'t worry about him. He\\'s on Jareth\\'s payroll now.\\n\\nHOGGLE falls to the ground, then picks himself up.\\n\\nHOGGLE: Thash right. Jareth owes me sumthin\\' ... an\\' I\\'m here ta\\ncollect ...\\n\\nThey laugh at him, then step aside and let him enter.\\n\\n80\\tINT: CASTLE - NIGHT\\n\\nA GROUP OF GOBLINS stand in a circle in a corridor. They torment a\\ntiny, fuzzy yapping CREATURE with their nipper sticks. The CREATURE\\ngets away from them and goes scurrying down the corridor. The GOBLINS\\nlaugh. It turns a corner and starts yapping for all it\\'s worth.\\n\\nANOTHER ANGLE\\n\\nSARAH, LUDO and DIDYMUS pressed against the wall, trying to not be\\nnoticed. Unfortunately the little CREATURE has no sympathy for their\\nplight. It stands at their feet, making a ruckus.\\n\\nSARAH (whispering): Shut up, you little monster!\\n\\nLUDO bends down to pet it in the hopes of quieting it.\\n\\nLUDO: Nice ... thing ...\\n\\nBut the CREATURE doesn\\'t want a pet. It sinks its teeth into LUDO\\'s\\nhand. LUDO howls.\\n\\nDIDYMUS: I fear that this means trouble.\\n\\nThe GOBLINS yell and start running down the corridor.\\n\\nSARAH: Run for it!\\n\\nThey are off, the CREATURE and the GOBLINS at their heels.\\n\\n81\\tINT: CORRIDOR - NIGHT\\n\\nThe THREE are running for all they\\'re worth. SARAH pulls the watch\\nout of her pocket. It is on the 12:30.\\n\\nSARAH: Only a half hour left! We\\'ve got to find Freddie!\\n\\nANOTHER ANGLE\\n\\nYet another GROUP OF GOBLINS running right toward them. They stop in\\ntheir tracks and start running in the opposite direction.\\n\\n82\\tINT: INNER COURTYARD - NIGHT\\n\\nThe THREE come careening into the long narrow inner courtyard.\\nBalconies look down on it from the floor above. Opposite them is a\\nlarge ornate door. They have a lead on the GOBLINS chasing them, but\\nnot for long.\\n\\nANOTHER ANGLE\\n\\nOn one of the balconies a particularly repulsive little GOBLIN laughs\\nsadistically. The THREE look up and see the GOBLIN with his hands on\\na huge lever. He pushes it down gleefully and the floor opens up in\\nfront of the THREESOME. It appears to be a bottomless pit, too wide\\nto leap across. Horrified they look behind them and see the GOBLINS\\ngaining on them. And they\\'re throwing spears! Suddenly there is a\\ntriumphant yell from the balcony opposite the repulsive GOBLIN, and\\nthen a FIGURE leaps off it swinging on a rope.\\n\\nSARAH: Hoggle!\\n\\nIt certainly is! He wrestles with the hideous GOBLIN and in the\\nstruggle it falls screaming into the pit. HOGGLE then grabs the lever\\nand it is not a second too soon. The pursuing GOBLINS are entering\\nthe courtyard.\\n\\nANOTHER ANGLE\\n\\nThe floor closes and the THREE run to the door. An enraged PURSUER\\naims a spear at HOGGLE. He is hit. SARAH screams as LUDO struggles\\nwith the door. It won\\'t budge and he begins to smash his body against\\nit.\\n\\nANOTHER ANGLE\\n\\nA seemingly half-dead HOGGLE staggers to his feet and throws his body\\non the lever. He appears to faint from the strain but the weight of\\nhis body pushes the lever and the floor opens again.\\n\\nANOTHER ANGLE\\n\\nThe enraged GOBLINS are stopped in their tracks by the yawning pit.\\nThey hurl spears at the THREESOME but it is to no avail. LUDO smashes\\ndown the door and they run in.\\n\\n83\\tINT: JARETH\\'S QUARTERS - NIGHT\\n\\nSARAH, DIDYMUS, and LUDO carrying HOGGLE enter the room where we have\\nseen JARETH and FREDDIE. They lock the door behind them. No one is\\nthere and FREDDIE\\'s cradle is rocking, as if someone had removed him\\nonly moments before. LUDO places HOGGLE down and SARAH looks\\nfeverishly around the room. She spots a door.\\n\\nSARAH: That\\'s the only way he could have gone!\\n\\nShe runs to the door and LUDO and DIDYMUS follow.\\n\\nSARAH: No. I have to face him alone!\\n\\nDIDYMUS: But, my lady ...\\n\\nHe is interrupted by the sound of GOBLINS in pursuit. They start\\ntrying to smash down the door. LUDO runs to it and presses his body\\nagainst it. HOGGLE moans and DIDYMUS and SARAH run to his side.\\n\\nHOGGLE: I don\\'t expect ya to fergive me, Missy, but ...\\n\\nShe puts her finger to his lips.\\n\\nSARAH: Forgive you for what? Saving our lives?\\n\\nHOGGLE: But, I betrayed ya, I gave ya that damned peach ...\\n\\nSARAH: Ssh! You did the only thing you could do ...\\n\\nShe looks down at his empty belt.\\n\\nSARAH: ... and I see you lost all your treasures in the process.\\n\\nHOGGLE: I don\\'t care if I never sees another treasure again!\\n\\nSARAH (smiles): Here. Just in case you change your mind.\\n\\nShe slips off her mother\\'s ring and presses it into HOGGLE\\'s hand. He\\nis overwhelmed and SARAH smiles at his pleasure.\\n\\nHOGGLE: And Jareth said ya could never love me.\\n\\nSARAH: Jareth doesn\\'t know everything.\\n\\nShe leaps to her feet and HOGGLE moans.\\n\\nSARAH: Take care of him, Didymus.\\n\\nDIDYMUS: I\\'ll guard the valiant Hoggle with my life!\\n\\nThe GOBLINS give the door a particularly loud smash and LUDO presses\\nagainst the door even harder.\\n\\nLUDO: Ludo ... too!\\n\\nShe runs to the other door and stops to look back at them.\\n\\nSARAH: No maiden could have wished for nobler knights.\\n\\nAnd she is gone.\\n\\n84\\tESCHER ROTUNDA - NIGHT\\n\\nSARAH enters an overwhelming room with many staircases, balconies and\\ndoorways at different heights and at all kinds of strange angles that\\nobviously have no relation to what we know as gravity. Her knees\\nbuckling from vertigo. Then she gasps.\\n\\nANOTHER ANGLE\\n\\nJARETH is sitting on the wall with all the ease of a fly.\\n\\nJARETH: I\\'ve been expecting you.\\n\\nSARAH stumbles and falls into the room, ending up on the ceiling. She\\ntries to adjust to being upside down.\\n\\nSARAH: Where\\'s Freddie?!!!\\n\\nShe has to look down and sideways to see JARETH and it is clearly\\ngrueling.\\n\\nJARETH: He\\'s right there.\\n\\nAnd he points to one of the stairways that juts out at a right angle\\nfrom the wall. FREDDIE is climbing up the stairs happily, but from\\nSARAH\\'s point of view it looks like he will fall when he gets to the\\ntop.\\n\\nSARAH (screaming): Freddie! No!!!\\n\\nFREDDIE gets to the top but doesn\\'t fall, instead he ends up crawling\\nup the wall. SARAH sighs with relief and closes her eyes. This sends\\nher reeling and she ends up in one of the archways. She tries to\\norient herself but there is no up, no down, no sideways. And the BABY\\nis about to crawl off a balcony! SARAH screams and JARETH laughs. He\\nbegins a song that tells SARAH she never really understood what was\\ngain on. Nothing is what it appears to be, not even things like \"up\"\\nand \"down.\"\\n\\nANOTHER ANGLE\\n\\nFREDDIE in the most precarious-looking situation yet, at the top of a\\nstaircase. He hesitates to crawl down, and to lure him, JARETH\\ncreates a ball out of thin air and throws it to the BABY. Of course,\\nit bounces up. And all the while his song is taunting SARAH. She\\nturns away from him and looks into the large mirror framed in the\\narchway. She sees endless SARAHS. And while she\\'s looking, the first\\nreflection runs to the left, the reflection behind that to the right,\\nand so on all the way down the line. And SARAH\\'s still standing\\nthere! She falls backwards and ends up standing on the floor,\\nwatching FREDDIE chase his ball across the ceiling. JARETH dances on\\nthe wall now as he is about to finish his song. And there is FREDDIE\\non one of the balconies facing out of the rotunda. If he falls off\\nthat, he\\'ll really fall! SARAH runs up the opposite wall and finds\\nthat there is sheer space between her and the BABY. The only way to\\nreach him is to jump. She looks at JARETH who grins at her, then at\\nFREDDIE who is teetering on the edge. As JARETH comes to the end of\\nthe song there is nothing to do but jump. She looks at JARETH and\\ncan\\'t repress a grin of her own.\\n\\nSARAH: Like the man said, \"nothing is what it appears to be!\"\\n\\nShe jumps.\\n\\n85\\tINT: JARETH\\'S CHAMBERS - NIGHT\\n\\nSARAH falls right on to a magnificent huge bed. Opposite her JARETH\\nsits in a chair. FREDDIE, wrapped in a blanket, is gurgling on his\\nlap. SARAH reaches into her pocket and pulls out the watch. It is a\\nfew minutes before 13. JARETH stands up.\\n\\nJARETH: There\\'s still time.\\n\\nHe gestures to a clock on the wall that shows the same time as her\\nwatch. He places FREDDIE into a cradle and comes over to the bed. He\\nlooks down at her.\\n\\nJARETH: Besides, I\\'m no longer interested in having a little goblin\\nprince. I\\'ve decided I\\'d much rather have a queen.\\n\\nHe looks into her eyes for a moment. SARAH doesn\\'t look away.\\nInstead, she slowly eases herself off the bed and stands facing him.\\n\\nSARAH (archly): A queen? Have you chosen anyone I know.\\n\\nShe glides by him and walks to the window. JARETH chuckles\\nappreciatively.\\n\\nJARETH: You\\'ve come a long way, little girl.\\n\\nSARAH looks out at the labyrinth.\\n\\nSARAH: I certainly have.\\n\\nShe turns to face him.\\n\\nJARETH: Yes, I can see it in your eyes. (he moves closer to her) No\\none else has ever made it this far in the labyrinth, no one else has\\never been worthy ...\\n\\nHe takes her hand and brings it to his lips. She smiles\\ndown at him.\\n\\nSARAH: What\\'s your offer.\\n\\nJARETH stands quickly and looks at her. She certainly has come a long\\nway!\\n\\nJARETH: Why, everything ... you\\'ll rule by my side.\\n\\nSARAH: Everything? The chance to spend my life surrounded by\\nrepulsive goblins ... the chance to torment innocent creatures ...\\n\\nJARETH (shaking his head): ... the chance to never have a care in the\\nworld, to never have to do anything that you don\\'t want to do.\\n\\nSARAH looks at him.\\n\\nSARAH: Anything else?\\n\\nJARETH (smiling): Why, me. Of course.\\n\\nSARAH surreptitiously eyes the clock. There is about a minute left.\\nShe glides away from the window and tries to position herself closer\\nto FREDDIE.\\n\\nSARAH: And what if I\\'m not interested?\\n\\nJARETH reacts with surprise for a moment, then shakes his head.\\n\\nJARETH: Impossible. I know you, I know what you want ...\\n\\nSARAH: Well, I\\'ve got news for you, Jareth.\\n\\nShe makes a beeline for the cradle.\\n\\nSARAH: I don\\'t want _you_!\\n\\nShe\\'s almost at the cradle but JARETH grabs her arm and stops her.\\n\\nSARAH (shocked, enraged): Why, you miserable creep!\\n\\nJARETH has hold of her arms but she breaks away and hauls off and\\npunches him in the jaw. JARETH steps back, stunned. SARAH scoops up\\nthe screaming FREDDIE.\\n\\nSARAH: How could you do this to an innocent baby?!!\\n\\nJARETH stands rubbing his jaw, snivelling, stunned.\\n\\nJARETH: You hit me!\\n\\nSARAH, FREDDIE in her arms, goes right up to him.\\n\\nSARAH: And I\\'d like to do more ... you, you ... !\\n\\nShe is furious and wants to hit him again badly. Since she has the\\nBABY in her arms she makes do with kicking him hard in the shin.\\nJARETH howls and grabs his leg.\\n\\nSARAH: I wouldn\\'t want you if you were the last ... _goblin_ on earth!\\n\\nThe WHITE BIRD flies through the window and lands on SARAH\\'s\\nshoulder. JARETH puts his hands on his ears.\\n\\nJARETH: Don\\'t say that!\\n\\nBut it is too late, he starts shrinking.\\n\\nJARETH: Look at me! (whining) How could you do this to me!\\n\\nBefore SARAH\\'s eyes JARETH turns into an undersized, ineffective,\\nsnivelling little GOBLIN. The features are those of a goblin, but\\nstill recognizably JARETH.\\n\\n86\\tINT: CASTLE - NIGHT\\n\\nJARETH\\'s quarters, where DIDYMUS tends HOGGLE and LUDO still blocks\\nthe door.\\n\\nJARETH (VO) (whiney scream): Why does everything have to happen to me!\\n\\nThey look at each other and suddenly LUDO realizes that the GOBLINS\\nare no longer trying to break down the door. The THREE start to laugh.\\n\\nHOGGLE (proudly): She did it!\\n\\nThey cheer.\\n\\n87\\tINT: JARETH\\'S CHAMBERS - NIGHT\\n\\nJARETH, the bratty little GOBLIN, is throwing a tantrum.\\n\\nJARETH: Nobody ever cares about what I want!\\n\\nThe walls and floor shake so from his pounding fists and feet that a\\ncrack opens up right in front of SARAH\\'s feet. She looks at the clock\\nand the minute hand moves to the 13. She looks at FREDDIE. There\\'s\\nnothing to do but jump into the void. The clock begins to strike.\\n\\nSARAH: OK, Freddie. Time to go bye-bye!\\n\\nShe jumps.\\n\\n88\\tEXT: SKY - NIGHT\\n\\nSARAH and FREDDIE spinning through the dark, starry sky. The striking\\nof the clock continues.\\n\\nANOTHER ANGLE\\n\\nCLOSE ON SARAH AND FREDDIE. SARAH pulls him closer, lovingly. And\\nthey go on spinning.\\n\\n89\\tINT: NURSERY - NIGHT\\n\\nSARAH is lying face down on the floor. She comes to slowly and tries\\nto sit up. Groaning, she rubs her head where it bumped on the corner\\nof the open drawer. She tries to focus, blinking her eyes.\\n\\nANOTHER ANGLE\\n\\nSARAH\\'S POV - Her eyes slowly focus on FREDDIE\\'s crib. When she can\\nsee, she gasps. FREDDIE\\'s not there! The side of the crib is down and\\nthe BABY is nowhere to be seen.\\n\\nSARAH: Freddie!\\n\\nShe leaps to her feet woozily. Still rubbing her head she staggers\\nout into the hallway.\\n\\n90\\tINT: RAILWAY - NIGHT\\n\\nSARAH looks down the hallway and suddenly her face breaks out into a\\ndelighted grin.\\n\\nANOTHER ANGLE\\n\\nSARAH\\'S POV - LITTLE FREDDIE is crawling slowly, but determinedly,\\ninto SARAH\\'s room. When he gets to her bed he uses all his strength\\nto pull himself up on to his feet by holding on to the bedspread. Be\\nthen holds his hand out, trying to reach something.\\n\\nANOTHER ANGLE\\n\\nSARAH makes her way toward her room, delight and wonder on her face.\\n\\n91\\tINT: SARAH\\'S ROOM - NIGHT\\n\\nSARAH stands in the doorway looking down at FREDDIE.\\n\\nSARAH (softly): That\\'s quite a journey you took, Freddie.\\n\\nFREDDIE looks up at her and makes a sound. He continues straining,\\nand WE SEE that what he is reaching for is Lancelot, SARAH\\'s bear.\\nSARAH smiles, and lifts FREDDIE up. She sits on the bed, FREDDIE on\\nher lap, and hands him the bear.\\n\\nSARAH: Here. It\\'s yours.\\n\\nFREDDIE takes it happily.\\n\\nSARAH (smiling): You earned it.\\n\\nShe kisses his head and rocks him gently. Then she gazes out the\\nwindow at the stars.\\n\\n92\\tEXT: HOUSE - NIGHT\\n\\nThe light shines from SARAH\\'s window. The WHITE BIRD flutters down\\nfrom the starry sky. It perches in the tree beside the path.\\n\\nTHE END\\n\\n=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-='},\n",

His royal highness, King Triton! (Triton enters\\n  dramatically to wild cheering.) And presenting the distinguished court\\n  composer, Horatio Thelonious Ignatius Crustaceous Sebastian! (Sebastion\\n  enters to mild applause.)\\nTriton: I\\'m really looking forward to this performance, Sebastian.\\nSebastian: Oh, Your Majesty, this will be the finest concert I have ever con-\\n  ducted.  Your daughters - they will be spectacular!\\nTriton: Yes, and especially my little Ariel.\\nSebastian: Yes, yes, she has the most beautiful voice. . . .  [sotto] If only\\n  she\\'d show up for rehearsals once in a while. . . .

Ariel!!\\n\\n      (Cut to Ariel looking at sunken ship.)\\n\\nFlounder: (From distance.) Ariel, wait for me . . .\\nAriel: Flounder, hurry up!\\nFlounder: (Catching up.) You know I can\\'t swim that fast.\\nAriel: There it is.  Isn\\'t it fantastic?\\nFlounder: Yeah . . . sure . . . it - it\\'s great.  Now let\\'s get outta here.\\nAriel: You\\'re not getting cold fins now, are you?\\nFlounder: Who, me?  No way.  It\\'s just, it, err . . . it looks - damp in there.\\n  Yeah.  And I think I may be coming down with something.  Yeah, I got this\\n  cough. (Flounder coughs unconvincingly)\\nAriel: All right.  I\\'m going inside.  You can just stay here and - watch for\\n  sharks. (She goes inside.)\\nFlounder: O.K.  Yeah - you go.  I\\'ll stay and - what?  Sharks!  Ariel!\\n  (He tries to fit through porthole.) Ariel . . .

(Shark passes outside.)\\nAriel: Flounder, don\\'t be such a guppy.\\nFlounder: I\\'m not a guppy. (Gets pulled through porthole.)This is great - I\\n  mean, I really love this.  Excitement, adventure, danger lurking around\\n  every corn- YAAAAHHHHHHHH!! Ariel!! (He sees a skull, crashes into pillar\\n  causing cave in, and swims frantically away, knocking over Ariel.)\\nAriel: Oh, are you okay?\\nFlounder: Yeah sure, no problem, I\\'m okay . . .\\nAriel: Shhh . . . (Seeing a fork.) Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh! Have you ever\\n  seen anything so wonderful in your entire life?\\nFlounder: Wow, cool!  But, err, what is it?\\nAriel: I don\\'t know.  But I bet Scuttle will.\\n  (Puts fork in bag. Skark swims by outside.)\\nFlounder: What was that? Did you hear something?\\nAriel: (Distracted by pipe.) Hmm, I wonder what this one is?\\nFlounder: Ariel . .\\nAriel: Flounder, will you relax. Nothing is going to happen.\\nFlounder: (Seeing Shark looming behind him.) AAHHHH!! Run!! Run!! We\\'re\\n  gonna die!! (Shark chases them all around. Ariel\\'s bag is hung up. She\\n  goes back for it. Shark almost gets them. They head for porthole.) Oh No!!\\n  (They crash through and go round and round. Flounder gets knocked silly\\n  but Ariel saves him and traps Shark) You big bully.

Scuttle on his island humming and looking through his\\ntelescope.)\\n\\nAriel: Scuttle!\\nScuttle: (Looking through the telescope the wrong way, shouting.) Whoa!\\n   Mermaid off the port bow! Ariel, how you doin\\' kid? (Lowers telescope to\\n   reveal Ariel at wing\\'s length.) Whoa, what a swim!\\nAriel: Scuttle - look what we found.\\nFlounder: Yeah - we were in this sunken ship - it was really creepy.\\nScuttle: Human stuff, huh?  Hey, lemme see. (Picks up fork.) Look at this.\\n  Wow - this is special - this is very, very unusual.\\nAriel: What?  What is it?\\nScuttle: It\\'s a dinglehopper! Humans use these little babies . . . to\\n  straighten their hair out. See - just a little twirl here an\\' a yank\\n  there and - voiolay!  You got an aesthetically pleasing configuration\\n  of hair that humans go nuts over!\\nAriel: A dinglehopper!\\nFlounder: What about that one?\\nScuttle: (Holding pipe) Ah - this I haven\\'t seen in years.  This is wonderful!\\n  A banded, bulbous - snarfblat.\\nAriel and Flounder: Oohhh.\\nScuttle: Now, the snarfblat dates back to prehistorical times, when humans used\\n  to sit around, and stare at each other all day.  Got very boring.  So, they\\n  invented the snarfblat to make fine music.  Allow me.\\n  (Scuttle blows into the pipe; seaweed pops out the other end.)\\nAriel: Music?  Oh, the concert! Oh my gosh, my father\\'s gonna kill me!\\nFlounder: The concert was today?\\nScuttle: (Still contemplating pipe.) Maybe you could make a little planter\\n  out of it or somethin\\'.\\nAriel: Uh, I\\'m sorry, I\\'ve gotta go. Thank you Scuttle. (Waves.)\\nScuttle: Anytime sweetie, anytime.\\n\\n     (Cut to Flotsam and Jetsam, then Ursula in background watching magic\\nprojection of Ariel swimming.)\\n\\nUrsula: Yeeeeeees, hurry home, princess.  We wouldn\\'t want to miss old daddy\\'s\\n  celebration, now, would we?  Huh!  Celebration indeed.  Bah!  In MY day, we\\n  had fantastical feasts when I lived in the palace.  And now, look at me -\\n  wasted away to practically nothing - banished and exiled and practically\\n  starving, while he and his flimsy fish-folk celebrate.  Well, I\\'ll give \\'em\\n  something to celebrate soon enough.  Flotsam!  Jetsam!  I want you to keep an\\n  extra close watch on this pretty little daughter of his.  She may be the key\\n  to Triton\\'s undoing. . . .\\n\\n     (Fade to the palace throne room where Ariel is being admonished.)\\n\\nTriton: I just don\\'t know what we\\'re going to do with you, young lady.\\nAriel: Daddy, I\\'m sorry, I just forgot, I -\\nTriton: As a result of your careless behaviour -\\nSebastian: Careless and reckless behaviour!\\nTriton: - the entire celebration was, er -\\nSebastian: Well, it was ruined!  That\\'s all.  Completely destroyed! This\\n  concert was to be the pinnacle of my distinguished career. Now thanks to\\n  you I am the laughing stock of the entire kingdom!\\nFlounder: But it wasn\\'t her fault! Ah - well - first, ahh, this shark chased us\\n  - yeah - yeah!  And we tried to - but we couldn\\'t - and - grrrrrrrrr - and -\\n  and we - whoooaaaaaa - oh, and then we were safe. But then this seagull came,\\n  and it was this is this, and that is that, and -\\nTriton: Seagull?  What?  Oh - you went up to the surface again, didn\\'t you?\\n  DIDN\\'T YOU?\\nAriel: Nothing - happened. . . .\\nTriton: Oh, Ariel, How many times must we go through this?  You could\\'ve been\\n  seen by one of those barbarians - by - by one of those humans!\\nAriel: Daddy, they\\'re not barbarians!\\nTriton: They\\'re dangerous.  Do you think I want to see my youngest daughter\\n  snared by some fish-eater\\'s hook?\\nAriel: I\\'m sixteen years old - I\\'m not a child anymore -\\nTriton: Don\\'t you take that tone of voice with me young lady.  As long as you\\n  live under my ocean, you\\'ll obey my rules!\\nAriel: But if you would just listen -\\nTriton: Not another word - and I am never, NEVER to hear of you going to the\\n  surface again.  Is that clear? (Ariel leaves, crying.)\\nSebastian: Hm! Teenagers. . . .  They think they know everything.  You give\\n  them an inch, they swim all over you.\\nTriton: Do you, er, think I - I was too hard on her?\\nSebastian: Definitely not.  Why, if Ariel was my daughter, I\\'d show her who was\\n  boss.  None of this \"flitting to the surface\" and other such nonsense.  No,\\n  sir - I\\'d keep her under tight control.\\nTriton: You\\'re absolutely right, Sebastian.\\nSebastian: Of course.\\nTriton: Ariel needs constant supervision.\\nSebastian: Constant.\\nTriton: Someone to watch over her - to keep her out of trouble.\\nSebastian: All the time -\\nTriton: And YOU are just the crab to do it.\\n\\n     (Cut to Sebastion walking down corridor.)\\n\\nSebastian: How do I get myself into these situations?  I should be writing\\n  symphonies - not tagging along after some headstrong teenager. (Sees Ariel\\n  and Flounder sneaking off and follows.) Hmm? What is that girl up to? (He\\n  barely makes it into cave and sees Ariel\\'s collection.) Huh?\\nFlounder: Ariel, are you okay?\\nAriel: If only I could make him understand.  I just don\\'t see things the way he\\n  does. I don\\'t see how a world that makes such wonderful things - could be\\n  bad.\\n\\n   Look at this stuff\\n   Isn\\'t it neat?\\n   Wouldn\\'t you think my collection\\'s complete?\\n   Wouldn\\'t you think I\\'m the girl\\n   The girl who has ev\\'rything?\\n   Look at this trove\\n   Treasures untold\\n   How many wonders can one cavern hold?\\n   Lookin\\' around here you\\'d think\\n   Sure, she\\'s got everything\\n\\n   I\\'ve got gadgets and gizmos aplenty\\n   I\\'ve got whozits and whatzits galore\\n   (You want thingamabobs?\\n   I got twenty)\\n   But who cares?\\n   No big deal\\n   I want more\\n\\n   I wanna be where the people are\\n   I wanna see\\n   Wanna see \\'em dancin\\'\\n   Walkin\\' around on those\\n   (Whad\\'ya call \\'em?) oh - feet\\n   Flippin\\' your fins you don\\'t get too far\\n   Legs are required for jumpin\\', dancin\\'\\n   Strollin\\' along down a\\n   (What\\'s that word again?) street\\n\\n   Up where they walk\\n   Up where they run\\n   Up where they stay all day in the sun\\n   Wanderin\\' free\\n   Wish I could be\\n   Part of that world\\n\\n   What would I give\\n   If I could live\\n   Outta these waters?\\n   What would I pay\\n   To spend a day\\n   Warm on the sand?\\n   Betcha on land\\n   They understand\\n   Bet they don\\'t reprimand their daughters\\n   Bright young women\\n   Sick o\\' swimmin\\'\\n   Ready to stand\\n\\n   And ready to know what the people know\\n   Ask \\'em my questions\\n   And get some answers\\n   What\\'s a fire and why does it\\n   (What\\'s the word?) burn?\\n\\n   When\\'s it my turn?\\n   Wouldn\\'t I love\\n   Love to explore that shore above?\\n   Out of the sea\\n   Wish I could be\\n   Part of that world\\n\\n  (Sebastion has been struggling around and now comes crashing down making\\n  a lot of noise.)\\nAriel: Sebastion!?\\nSebastian: Ariel - what, are you mad?  How could you - what is all this?\\nAriel: It, err, it\\'s just my - collection. . . .\\nSebastian: Oh.  I see.  Your collection.  Hmmm.  IF YOUR FATHER KNEW ABOUT THIS\\n  PLACE HE\\'D -\\nFlounder: You\\'re not gonna tell him, are you?\\nAriel: Oh, please, Sebastian, he would never understand.\\nSebastian: Ariel.  You\\'re under a lot of pressure down here.  Come with me,\\n  I\\'ll take you home and get you something warm to drink. (A ship passes by\\n  overhead.)\\nAriel: What do you suppose?. . .\\nSebastion: Ariel? Ariel!\\n\\n     (On surface. Fireworks in the sky around ship. Ariel looks on,\\namazed. Sebastion and Flounder arrive.)\\n\\nSebastion: Ariel, what - what are you- jumpin\\' jellyfish! Ariel, Ariel!\\n  Please come back! (Ariel swims to ship and watches party until Max finds\\n  her.)\\nEric: (Whistles.) Max, here boy. Hey, come on, mutt, whatcha doing, huh\\n  Max? Good boy. (Ariel sees him and is stricken.)\\nScuttle: Hey there, sweetie!  Quite a show, eh?\\nAriel: Scuttle, be quiet!  They\\'ll hear you.\\nScuttle: Oooh, I gotcha, I gotcha.  We\\'re being intrepidatious.  WE\\'RE OUT TO\\n  DISCOVER! (Ariel grabs his beak.)\\nAriel: I\\'ve never seen a human this close before.  Oh - he\\'s very handsome,\\n  isn\\'t he?\\nScuttle: (Looking at Max) I dunno, he looks kinda hairy and slobbery to me.\\nAriel: Not that one - the one playing the snarfblat.\\nGrimsby: Silence!  Silence!  It is now my honour and privilege to present our\\n  esteemed Prince Eric with a very special, very expensive, very large birthday\\n  present.\\nEric: Ah, Grimsby - y\\'old beanpole, you shouldn\\'t have.\\nGrimsby: I know. Happy birthday, Eric! (Large, gaudy statue of Eric is\\n  revealed. Max growls.)\\nEric: Gee, Grim.  It\\'s, err, it\\'s, err - it\\'s really somethin\\'. . . .\\nGrimsby: Yes, I commissioned it myself.  Of course, I had hoped it would be a\\n  wedding present, but . . .\\nEric: Come on, Grim, don\\'t start.  Look, you\\'re not still sore because I didn\\'t\\n  fall for the princess of Glauerhaven, are you?\\nGrimsby: Oh, Eric, it isn\\'t me alone.  The entire kingdom wants to see you\\n  happily settled down with the right girl.\\nEric: Well, she\\'s out there somewhere.  I just - I just haven\\'t found her yet.\\nGrimsby: Well, perhaps you haven\\'t been looking hard enough.\\nEric: Believe me, Grim, when I find her I\\'ll know - without a doubt.  It\\'ll\\n  just - bam! - hit me - like lightning. (Lightning and thunder appear and the\\n  sky grows dark.)\\nSailor: Hurricane a\\'commin\\'!! Stand fast! Secure the riggin\\'! (Storm hits.)\\nScuttle: Whoa! The wind\\'s all of a sudden on the move here. (He is blown\\n  away.) Oh! Ariel . . . (Ship crashes through storm. Lightning starts a fire.\\n  A rock looms ahead.)\\nEric: Look out! . . . (Ship crashes and all are thrown overboard except Max.)\\n  Grim, hang on! (Sees Max.) Max! (Goes back to save him.) Jump Max! Come\\n  on boy, jump! You can do it Max. (He saves Max but is trapped on board.)\\nGrimsby: ERIC! (Ship explodes. Ariel finds Eric near drowning and pulls him\\n  away.)\\n\\n     (On beach. Ariel is sitting next to an unconscious Eric.)\\n\\nAriel: Is he - dead?\\nScuttle: (Opens Eric\\'s eyelid.) It\\'s hard to say. (Puts his ear against Eric\\'s\\n  foot.)  Oh, I - I can\\'t make out a heartbeat.\\nAriel: No, look! He\\'s breathing. He\\'s so, beautiful.\\n\\n   What would I give\\n   To live where you are?\\n   What would I pay\\n   To stay here beside you?\\n   What would I do to see you\\n   Smiling at me?\\n\\n   Where would we walk?\\n   Where would we run?\\n   If we could stay all day in the sun?\\n   Just you and me\\n   And I could be\\n   Part of your world\\n\\n  (Sebastion and Flounder have washed up and are watching scene. Max and\\n  Grimsby approach. Ariel hurries away.)\\nGrimsby: Eric!  Oh, Eric.  You really delight in these sadistic strains on my\\n  blood pressure, don\\'t you?\\nEric: A girl - rescued me. . . .  She was - singing . . . she had the most -\\n  beautiful voice.\\nGrimsby: Ah, Eric, I think you\\'ve swallowed a bit too much seawater.  Off we\\n  go.  Come on, Max.\\nSebastian: We just gotta forget this whole thing ever happened.  The sea king\\n  will never know.  You won\\'t tell him, I won\\'t tell him.  I will stay in one\\n  piece.\\nAriel:\\n   I don\\'t know when\\n   I don\\'t know how\\n   But I know something\\'s starting right now\\n   Watch and you\\'ll see\\n   Some day I\\'ll be\\n   Part of your world\\n\\n     (Flotsam and Jetsam appear. Fade to Ursula watching from her chamber.)\\n\\nUrsula: Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I can\\'t stand it - it\\'s too easy.  The\\n  child is in love with a human.  And not just any human - a prince!  Her\\n  daddy\\'ll LOVE that.  King Triton\\'s headstrong, lovesick girl would make a\\n  charming addition to my little garden.\\n\\n     (Fade to palace. Then sister\\'s dressing room.)\\n\\nAndrina: Ariel, dear, time to come out.  You\\'ve been in there all morning.\\n  (Ariel emerges, singing to herself.)\\nAtina: What is with her lately?\\nAriel: Morning, Daddy.  (Ariel swims off.)\\nAtina: Oh, she\\'s got it bad.\\nTriton: What? What has she got?\\nAndrina: Isn\\'t it obvious, Daddy?  Ariel\\'s in love.\\nTriton: Ariel?  In love?\\n\\n     (Cut to Sebastion pacing on rock outside.)\\n\\nSebastian: O.K. So far, so good.  I don\\'t think the king knows. But it will not\\n  be easy keeping something like this a secret for long.\\nAriel: (Picking petals off a flower) He loves me . . . hmmm, he loves me\\n  not. . . .  He loves me!  I knew it!\\nSebastian: Ariel, stop talking crazy.\\nAriel: I gotta see him again - tonight!  Scuttle knows where he lives.\\nSebastian: Ariel - please.  Will you get your head out of the clouds and back\\n  in the water where it belongs?\\nAriel: I\\'ll swim up to his castle.  Then Flounder will splash around to get his\\n  attention, and then with -\\nSebastian: Down HERE is your home! Ariel - listen to me.  The human world -\\n  it\\'s a mess.  Life under the sea is better than anything they got up there.\\n\\n   The seaweed is always greener\\n   In somebody else\\'s lake\\n   You dream about going up there\\n   But that is a big mistake\\n   Just look at the world around you\\n   Right here on the ocean floor\\n   Such wonderful things surround you\\n   What more is you lookin\\' for?\\n\\n   Under the sea\\n   Under the sea\\n   Darling it\\'s better\\n   Down where it\\'s wetter\\n   Take it from me\\n   Up on the shore they work all day\\n   Out in the sun they slave away\\n   While we devotin\\'\\n   Full time to floatin\\'\\n   Under the sea\\n\\n   Down here all the fish is happy\\n   As off through the waves they roll\\n   The fish on the land ain\\'t happy\\n   They sad \\'cause they in their bowl\\n   But fish in the bowl is lucky\\n   They in for a worser fate\\n   One day when the boss get hungry\\n   Guess who\\'s gon\\' be on the plate\\n\\n   Under the sea\\n   Under the sea\\n   Nobody beat us\\n   Fry us and eat us\\n   In fricassee\\n   We what the land folks loves to cook\\n   Under the sea we off the hook\\n   We got no troubles\\n   Life is the bubbles\\n   Under the sea\\n   Under the sea\\n   Since life is sweet here\\n   We got the beat here\\n   Naturally\\n   Even the sturgeon an\\' the ray\\n   They get the urge \\'n\\' start to play\\n   We got the spirit\\n   You got to hear it\\n   Under the sea\\n\\n   The newt play the flute\\n   The carp play the harp\\n   The plaice play the bass\\n   And they soundin\\' sharp\\n   The bass play the brass\\n   The chub play the tub\\n   The fluke is the duke of soul\\n   (Yeah)\\n   The ray he can play\\n   The lings on the strings\\n   The trout rockin\\' out\\n   The blackfish she sings\\n   The smelt and the sprat\\n   They know where it\\'s at\\n   An\\' oh that blowfish blow\\n\\n   Under the sea\\n   Under the sea\\n   When the sardine\\n   Begin the beguine\\n   It\\'s music to me\\n   What do they got?

I must remain calm.  (Five octaves\\n  higher than normal) Yes - (loco) yes, Your Majesty.\\nTriton: Now, Sebastian, I\\'m concerned about Ariel.  Have you noticed she\\'s been\\n  acting peculiar lately?\\nSebastian: Peculiar?\\nTriton: You know, moaning about, daydreaming, singing to herself. . . .  You\\n  haven\\'t noticed, hmm?\\nSebastian: Oh - well, I -\\nTriton: Sebastian. . . .\\nSebastian: Hmmm?\\nTriton: I know you\\'ve been keeping something from me. . . .\\nSebastian: Keeping . . . something?\\nTriton: About Ariel?\\nSebastian: Ariel . . . ?\\nTriton: In love?\\nSebastian: I tried to stop her, sir.  She wouldn\\'t listen.  I told her to stay\\n  away from humans - they are bad, they are trouble, they -\\nTriton: Humans?  WHAT ABOUT HUMANS?\\nSebastian: Humans?  Ho ho ho ho. . . . Who said anything about humans?\\n\\n     (Fade to Ariel and Flounder entering cave.)\\n\\nAriel: Flounder, why can\\'t you just tell me what this is all about?\\nFlounder: You\\'ll see.

This\\n  is all so - so sudden. . . . (Turns around and sees Triton.) Daddy! . . .\\nTriton: I consider myself a reasonable merman. I set certain rules, and I\\n  expect those rules to be obeyed.\\nAriel: But Daddy!-\\nTriton: Is it true you rescued a human from drowing?\\nAriel: Daddy, I had to-\\nTriton: Contact between the human world and the mer-world is strictly for-\\n  bidden.

We mustn\\'t lurk in doorways - it\\'s rude.\\n  One MIGHT question your upbringing. . . . Now, then.  You\\'re here because\\n  you have a thing for this human.  This, er, prince fellow.  Not that I blame\\n  you - he is quite a catch, isn\\'t he?  Well, angel fish, the solution to your\\n  problem is simple.  The only way to get what you want - is to become a human\\n  yourself.\\nAriel: Can you DO that?\\nUrsula: My dear, sweet child. That\\'s what I do - it\\'s what I live for. To help\\n  unfortunate merfolk - like yourself. Poor souls with no one else to turn to.\\n\\n   I admit that in the past I\\'ve been a nasty\\n   They weren\\'t kidding when they called me, well, a witch\\n   But you\\'ll find that nowadays\\n   I\\'ve mended all my ways\\n   Repented, seen the light and made a switch\\n   True? Yes\\n\\n   And I fortunately know a little magic\\n   It\\'s a talent that I always have possessed\\n   And here lately, please don\\'t laugh\\n   I use it on behalf\\n   Of the miserable, lonely and depressed\\n   (Pathetic)\\n\\n   Poor unfortunate souls\\n   In pain\\n   In need\\n   This one longing to be thinner\\n   That one wants to get the girl\\n   And do I help them?\\n   Yes, indeed\\n   Those poor unfortunate souls\\n   So sad\\n   So true\\n   They come flocking to my cauldron\\n   Crying, \"Spells, Ursula please!\"\\n   And I help them?\\n   Yes, I do\\n\\n   Now it\\'s happened once or twice\\n   Someone couldn\\'t pay the price\\n   And I\\'m afraid I had to rake \\'em \\'cross the coals\\n   Yes, I\\'ve had the odd complaint\\n   But on the whole I\\'ve been a saint\\n   To those poor unfortunate souls\\n\\n  Now, here\\'s the deal.  I will make you a potion that will turn you into\\n  a human for three days.  Got that?  Three days.  Now listen, this is import-\\n  ant.  Before the sun sets on the third day, you\\'ve got to get dear ol\\'\\n  princey to fall in love with you.  That is, he\\'s got to kiss you.  Not just\\n  any kiss - the kiss of true love.  If he does kiss you before the sun sets on\\n  the third day, you\\'ll remain human, permanently, but - if he doesn\\'t, you\\n  turn back into a mermaid, and - you belong to me.\\nSebastion: No Ariel! (He is silenced by Flotsam and Jetsam.)\\nUrsula: Have we got a deal?\\nAriel: If I become human, I\\'ll never be with my father or sisters again.\\nUrsula: That\\'s right. . . .  But - you\\'ll have your man.  Life\\'s full of tough\\n  choices, innit? Oh - and there is one more thing. We haven\\'t discussed the\\n  subject of payment.  You can\\'t get something for nothing, you know.\\nAriel: But I don\\'t have any -\\nUrsula: I\\'m not asking much. Just a token, really, a trifle.  You\\'ll never even\\n  miss it.  What I want from you is . . . your voice.\\nAriel: My voice?\\nUrsula: You\\'ve got it, sweetcakes.  No more talking, singing, zip.\\nAriel: But without my voice, how can I -\\nUrsula: You\\'ll have your looks! Your pretty face! And don\\'t underestimate the\\n  importance of body language! Ha!\\n\\n   The men up there don\\'t like a lot of blabber\\n   They think a girl who gossips is a bore\\n   Yes, on land it\\'s much preferred\\n   For ladies not to say a word\\n   And after all, dear, what is idle prattle for?\\n\\n   Come on, they\\'re not all that impressed with conversation\\n   True gentlemen avoid it when they can\\n   But they dote and swoon and fawn\\n   On a lady who\\'s withdrawn\\n   It\\'s she who holds her tongue who gets her man\\n\\n   Come on, you poor unfortunate soul\\n   Go ahead!\\n   Make your choice!\\n   I\\'m a very busy woman\\n   And I haven\\'t got all day\\n   It won\\'t cost much\\n   Just your voice!\\n   You poor unfortunate soul\\n   It\\'s sad\\n   But true\\n   If you want to cross a bridge, my sweet\\n   You\\'ve got to pay the toll\\n   Take a gulp and take a breath\\n   And go ahead and sign the scroll!\\n   Flotsam, Jetsam, now I\\'ve got her, boys\\n   The boss is on a roll\\n   This poor unfortunate soul.\\n\\n  (Ariel signs contract.)\\n   Paluga, sarruga, come winds of the Caspian Sea.\\n   Now rings us glossitis and max laryngitis,\\n   La voce to me!\\n  Now . . . sing!\\nAriel: (Sings.)\\nUrsula: Keep singing! (Giant magical hands rip out Ariel\\'s voice and give it to\\n  Ursula. She laughs as Ariel is changed into a human and rushed to the surf-\\n  ace by Flounder and Sebastion.)\\n\\n     (Fade to beach. Eric and Max are walking near castle.)\\n\\nEric: (Playing flute.) That voice. I can\\'t get it out of my head. I\\'ve looked\\n  everywhere, Max - where could she be? (On other side of rocks Ariel is\\n  washed up. Sebastion and Flounder are exausted. Ariel sees her legs and is\\n  amazed.)\\nScuttle: Well, look at what the catfish dragged in!  Look at ya!  Look at ya!\\n  There\\'s something different.  Don\\'t tell me - I got it.  It\\'s your hairdo,\\n  right?  You\\'ve been using the dinglehopper, right?  No?  No huh, well let me\\n  see.  New . . . seashells?  No new seashells.

She traded her voice to the sea witch\\n  and got legs.  Jeez, man . . .\\nScuttle: I knew that.\\nFlounder: Ariel\\'s been turned into a human. She\\'s gotta make the prince fall in\\n  love with her, and he\\'s gotta ki- he\\'s gotta kiss her. (Ariel tries to get\\n  up.)\\nSebastion: And she\\'s only got three days. Just look at her. On legs. On human\\n  legs! My nerves are shot. This is a catastrophe!  What would her father say?\\n  I\\'ll tell you what her father\\'d say, he\\'d say he\\'s gonna kill himself a crab,\\n  that\\'s what her father\\'d say! I\\'m gonna march meself straight home right now\\n  and tell him just like I shoulda done de minute- (Ariel grabs him.) . . . and\\n  don\\'t you shake your head at me, young lady.  Maybe there\\'s still time. If\\n  we could get that witch to give you back your voice, you could go home with\\n  all the normal fish, and just be . . . just be . . . just be miserable for\\n  the rest of your life.  All right, all right.  I\\'ll try to help you find that\\n  prince.  Boy.  What a soft-shell I\\'m turning out to be.\\nScuttle: Now, Ariel, I\\'m tellin\\' ya, if you wanna be a human the first thing\\n  you gotta do is dress like one. Now lemme see.\\n\\n     (Cut to Eric and Max. Max smells Ariel and gets excited.)\\n\\nEric: Max? Huh . . . what, Max!\\nScuttle: (Whistles.) Ya look great kid. Ya look - sensational. (They hear Max.\\n  He arrives and chases Ariel up on a rock.)\\nEric: Max . . . Max - Quiet Max! What\\'s gotten into you fella? (Sees Ariel.)\\n  Oh . . . Oh, I see. Are you O.K., miss?

I mean really, this girl shows up in rags and\\n  doesn\\'t speak-\\nSebastion: Madame, please ! . . .\\nWoman 2: . . . not my idea of a princess. If Eric\\'s looking for a girl, I know\\n  a couple of highly available ones right here . . . (Sebastion dives into\\n  kitchen and sees various fish cooking.

Nice young ladies just don\\'t - swim around\\n  rescuing people in the middle of the ocean and then - flutter off into\\n  oblivion, like some -\\nEric: I\\'m tellin\\' you, Grim, she was REAL!  I\\'m gonna find that girl - and I\\'m\\n  gonna marry her.\\nCarlotta: Ha Ha. Come on honey. Don\\'t be shy. (Ariel enteres in a beautiful\\n  dress.)\\nGrimsby: Oh, Eric, isn\\'t she a vision?\\nEric: You look - wonderful.\\nGrimsby: Come come come, you must be famished. Let me help you my dear. There\\n  we go - ah - quite comfy? Uh. It\\'s - It\\'s not ofen that we have such a lovely\\n  dinner guest, eh Eric? (Ariel starts combing hair with a fork. They look\\n  dumbfounded and she is embarrased. She sees pipe and brightens.) Uh, do you\\n  like it? It is rather - fine . . . (She blows its contents into his face.\\n  Eric laughs.)\\nCarlotta: Oh, my!\\nEric: Ahem, so sorry Grim.\\nCarlotta: Why, Eric, that\\'s the first time I\\'ve seen you smile in weeks.\\nGrimsby: (Wiping his face.) Oh, very amusing. Carlotta, my dear, what\\'s for\\n  dinner?\\nCarlotta: Oooh, you\\'re gonna love it.  Chef\\'s been fixing his specialty,\\n  stuffed crab.\\n\\n     (Cut to Sebastion watching Louis cook. He is humming to himself.)\\n\\nLouis:\\n   Les poissons\\n   Les poissons\\n   How I love les poissons\\n   Love to chop\\n   And to serve little fish\\n   First I cut off their heads\\n   Then I pull out the bones\\n   Ah mais oui\\n   Ca c\\'est toujours delish\\n   Les poissons\\n   Les poissons\\n   Hee hee hee\\n   Hah hah hah\\n   With the cleaver I hack them in two\\n   I pull out what\\'s inside\\n   And I serve it up fried\\n   God, I love little fishes\\n   Don\\'t you?\\n\\n   Here\\'s something for tempting the palate\\n   Prepared in the classic technique\\n   First you pound the fish flat with a mallet\\n   Then you slash through the skin\\n   Give the belly a slice\\n   Then you rub some salt in\\n   \\'Cause that makes it taste nice\\n  Zut alors, I have missed one!\\n\\n   Sacre bleu\\n   What is this?\\n   How on earth could I miss\\n   Such a sweet little succulent crab?\\n   Quel dommage\\n   What a loss\\n   Here we go in the sauce\\n   Now some flour, I think\\n   Just a dab\\n   Now I stuff you with bread\\n   It don\\'t hurt \\'cause you\\'re dead\\n   And you\\'re certainly lucky you are\\n   \\'Cause it\\'s gonna be hot\\n   In my big silver pot\\n   Toodle loo mon poisson\\n   Au revoir!\\n\\n  (Sebastion hops back and Louis grabs him again.) What is this? (Sebastion\\n  pinches his nose and a battle ensues. Louis knocks over a large cabinet.)\\n\\n     (Cut to dining room. Huge crash is heard.)\\n\\nCarlotta: I think I\\'d better go see what Louis is up to.\\n\\n     (Back to kitchen. Louis is trashing the place.)\\n\\nLouis: Come out you little pipsqueak and fight like a man!\\nCarlotta: Louis!  What are you doing?\\nLouis: Well - I - I was just - er, er, I\\'m sorry, madame.\\n\\n     (Cut back to dining room.)\\n\\nGrimsby: You know, Eric, perhaps our young guest might enjoy seeing some of the\\n  sights of the kingdom.  Something in the way of a tour?\\nEric: I\\'m sorry, Grim, what was that?\\nGrimsby: You can\\'t spend all your time moping about, you need to get out.  Do\\n  something, have a life.  (Grimsby lifts his plate\\'s cover to reveal Sebastian\\n  cowering in the salad.)  Get your mind off -\\nEric: Easy, Grim, Easy.  (Ariel lifts her own plate cover and signals for\\n  Sebastian to hide there.  Sebastian rushes across while no one is looking.)\\n  It\\'s not a bad idea.  If she\\'s interested.  Well - whaddaya say?  Would you\\n  like to join me on a tour of my kingdom tomorrow?\\n  (Ariel nods vigorously, leaning heavily on her plate\\'s cover.)\\nGrimsby: Wonderful, now let\\'s eat, before this crab wanders off my plate.\\n\\n     (Fade to Ariel watching Eric and Max from balcony.)\\n\\nEric: Come here boy! . . . Arrr . . . (He sees Ariel and waves. She is emb-\\n  arassed and goes back inside.)\\nSebastian: This has got to be, without a doubt, the single most humiliating day\\n  of my life.  I hope you appreciate what I go through for you, young lady.\\n  Now - we got to make a plan to get that boy to kiss you.  Tomorrow, when he\\n  takes you for that ride, you gotta look your best.  You gotta bat your eyes -\\n  like this.  You gotta pucker up your lips - like this. (He sees she is\\n  asleep.) Hm. You are hopeless child. You know dat? Completely hopeless . . .\\n\\n     (Fade to undersea palace. Seahorse swims up to Triton.)\\n\\nTriton: Any sign of them?\\nSeahorse: No, Your Majesty.  We\\'ve searched everywhere.  We\\'ve found no trace\\n  of your daughter - or Sebastian.\\nTriton: Well, keep looking.  Leave no shell unturned, no coral unexplored.  Let\\n  no one in this kingdom sleep until she\\'s safe at home.\\nSeahorse: Yes sire. (He leaves.)\\nTriton: Oh, what have I done? What have I done?\\n\\n     (Morning at castle. Ariel and Eric leave for their tour. Ariel is amazed\\nby everything.)\\nFlounder: (As they pass water.) Has he kissed her yet?\\nSebastion: Not yet.\\nFlounder: Ohh . . . (Ariel and Eric go dancing and see the town.)\\nScuttle: Yo, Flounder! Any kissing?\\nFlounder: No, not yet.\\nScuttle: Hmm. Well they - they better get crackin\\'. (They leave town and Ariel\\n  drives, almost crashing. They end up rowing on a still lagoon in the even-\\n  ing.)\\nFlounder: Move over - move your big feathers.  I can\\'t see a thing.\\nScuttle: Nothing is happening. . . .  Only one day left, and that boy ain\\'t\\n  puckered up once.  O.K.  All right, this calls for a little vocal romantic\\n  stimulation. Stand back. (He flies over and sings very badly.)\\nEric: Wow. Somebody should find that poor animal and put it out of its misery.\\nSebastian: Jeez, man, I\\'m surrounded by amateurs!  You want something done,\\n  you\\'ve got to do it yourself.  First, we got to create the mood.\\n  Percussion. . . .  Strings. . . .  Winds. . . .

The little tramp!\\n  Oh, she\\'s better than I thought.  At this rate, he\\'ll be kissing her by\\n  sunset for sure.  Well, it\\'s time Ursula took matters into her own tentacles!\\n  Triton\\'s daughter will be mine - and then I\\'ll make him writhe.  I\\'ll see him\\n  wriggle like a worm on a hook! (Laughing, she transforms into a human with\\n  Ariel\\'s voice.)\\n\\n     (Fade to castle at night. Eric is playing the flute and contemplating as\\nGrimsby approaches.)\\n\\nGrimsby: Eric, if I may say, far better than any dream girl, is one of flesh\\n  and blood, one warm and caring, and right before your eyes. (He sees Ariel,\\n  sighs, and tosses away flute. He is distracted by Ursula/Vanessa singing with\\n  Ariel\\'s voice and is placed under her spell.)\\n\\n     (Scuttle flying toward castle in morning.)\\n\\nScuttle: Ariel!  Ariel, wake up!  Wake up!  I just heard the news.  Congratula-\\n  tions, kiddo, we did it!\\nSebastian: What is this idiot babbling about?\\nScuttle: Right - as if you two didn\\'t know, uh?  The whole town\\'s buzzin\\' about\\n  the prince gettin\\' himself hitched this afternoon!  You know, he\\'s getting\\n  married!  You silly sidewalker!  I just wanted to wish you luck.  I\\'ll catch\\n  you later, I wouldn\\'t miss it! (Ariel brightens and runs downstairs, only to\\n  see Eric and Vanessa together.)\\nGrimsby: Well, uh - err, Eric.  I-it appears that I was mistaken.  This mystery\\n  maiden of yours does - in fact exist.  And - and she is lovely.  Congratula-\\n  tions, my dear.\\nEric: We wish to be married as soon as possible.\\nGrimsby: Oh, yes - of course, Eric, but, er - but these things do take time,\\n  you know. . . .\\nEric: This afternoon, Grimsby.  The wedding ship departs at sunset.\\nGrimsby: Oh, oh - very well, Eric - as you wish. (Ariel runs off crying.)\\n\\n     (Cut to late afternoon as wedding ship starts to leave. Ariel on pier\\ncrying bitterly as Sebastion and Flounder look on.)\\n\\n     (Cut to Scuttle flying and humming to himself.)\\n\\nVanessa: What a lovely little bride I\\'ll make, my dear I\\'ll look divine\\n  Things are working out according to my ultimate design\\n  Soon I\\'ll have that little mermaid and the ocean will be mine!\\nScuttle: (Seeing real Ursula in mirror.) The sea witch! Oh no . . . She\\'s-\\n  I gotta. . . (Runs into side of ship. Flies off to find Ariel.) Ariel!\\n  Ariel!  Ariel.  I was flying, I wa - of course I was flying - An\\' - I s- I\\n  saw that the watch - the witch was watchin\\' a mirror, and she was singin\\'\\n  with a stolen set o\\' pipes!  Do you hear what I\\'m tellin\\' you? THE PRINCE\\n  IS MARRYING THE SEA WITCH IN DISGUISE!\\nSebastian: Are you sure about this?\\nScuttle: Have I ever been wrong?  I mean when it\\'s important!\\nFlounder: What are we gonna do!? (Ariel hears Ursula\\'s voice in her head as the\\n  sun drops.)\\nUrsula: . . . Before the sun sets on the third day. . . . (Ariel jumps in water\\n  but can\\'t swim well. Sebastion sends down some barrels.)\\nSebastion: Ariel, grab on to that. Flounder, get her to that boat as fast as\\n  your fins can carry you!\\nFlounder: I\\'ll try.\\nSebastian: I\\'ve gotta get to the sea king.  He must know about this.\\nScuttle: What - What about me?  What about ME?\\nSebastian: You - find a way to STALL THAT WEDDING!\\nScuttle: Stall the wedding. Wh- what am I - what - that\\'s it! (He flies off to\\n  rally the animals and fish.) Move it, let\\'s go, we got an emergency here!\\n\\n     (Cut to wedding in progress. Max growls at Vanessa but she kicks him.)\\n\\nPriest: Dearly beloved . . . (Flounder is pulling Ariel toward ship.)\\nFlounder: Don\\'t worry Ariel. ugh - we - we\\'re gonna make it. We\\'re almost\\n  there.\\nPriest: Yes, um, do you Eric, take Vanessa, to be your lawfully wedded wife,\\n  for as long as you both shall live?\\nEric: (Under spell.)

You\\'re the one.\\nVanessa: Eric, get away from her!\\nEric: It - it was you all the time.\\nAriel: Oh, Eric, I - I wanted to tell you.\\nVanessa: ERIC NO! (The sun sets and Ariel becomes a mermaid.)\\nUrsula: You\\'re too late!  You\\'re too late!  So long, loverboy.\\nEric: Ariel! (Ursula and Ariel go overboard.)\\nUrsula: Poor little princess - it\\'s not you I\\'m after.  I\\'ve a much bigger fish\\n  to -\\nTriton: Ursula, stop!\\nUrsula: Why, King Triton!  Ha ha ha - How ARE you?\\nTriton: Let her go.\\nUrsula: Not a chance, Triton!  She\\'s mine now.  We made a deal.\\nAriel: Daddy, I\\'m sorry!  I - I - I didn\\'t mean to.  I didn\\'t know -\\n  (Triton attacks the contract with a fierce blast from his trident, to no\\n  avail.)\\nUrsula: You see? The contract\\'s legal, binding and completely unbreakable -\\n  even for YOU. Of course, I always was a girl with an eye for a bargain.\\n  The daughter of the great sea king is a very precious commodity.  But - I\\n  might be willing to make an exchange for someone even better. . . .\\n\\n     (Cut to Eric rowing away from ship.)\\n\\nGrimsby: Eric! What are you doing?\\nEric: Grim, I lost her once. I\\'m not going to lose her again.\\n\\n     (Back to Ursula and Triton.)\\n\\nUrsula: Now! Do we have a deal? (Triton signs contract.) Ha! It\\'s done then.\\n  (Ariel is released and Triton is withered as Ursula laughs.)\\nAriel: No . . . Oh, No!\\nSebastion: Oh, your majesty . . .\\nAriel: Daddy? . . .\\nUrsula: (Picks up crown.) At last, it\\'s mine. Ho, Ho . . .\\nAriel: You - You monster!\\nUrsula: Don\\'t fool with me you little brat! Contract or no- AAAAHH! (She is hit\\n  with a harpoon thrown by Eric.) Why you little troll!\\nAriel: Eric! Eric look out!\\nUrsula: After him! (Flotsam and Jetsam attack.)\\nSebastion: Come on! . . .\\nUrsula: Say goodbye to your sweetheart. (Ariel makes her miss Eric and blast\\n  Flotsam and Jetsam.) Babies!  My poor, little poopsies!\\n\\n     (On surface as Ursula grows beneath.)\\n\\nAriel: Eric, you\\'ve got to get away from here.\\nEric: No, I won\\'t leave you.\\nUrsula: (Now very large.) You pitiful, insignificant, fool!\\nEric: Look out!\\nUrsula: Now I am the ruler of all the ocean!  The waves obey my every whim!\\n  The sea and all its spoils bow to my power! (She wrecks havoc, creates a\\n  whirlpool and raises some shipwrecks.)\\nAriel: ERIC! (He gets on board one of the ships as Ariel falls to the bottom\\n  of the whirlpool. Ursula attempts to blast her.)\\nUrsula: (Laughing wickedly.) So much for true love! (As Ursula is about to\\n  finish Ariel, Eric steers the ship into her. She is impaled and dies most\\n  horribly. Eric collapses on the shore. The trident falls back to Triton and\\n  everything reverts to normal.)\\n\\n     (Fade to morning with Eric on beach and Ariel watching from a distance.\\nTriton and Sebastion look on.)\\n\\nTriton: She really does love him, doesn\\'t she, Sebastian?\\nSebastian: Well, it\\'s like I always say, Your Majesty.  Children got to be free\\n  to lead their own lives.\\nTriton: You - always say that? (sighs) Then I guess there\\'s just one problem\\n  left.\\nSebastian: And what\\'s that, Your Majesty?\\nTriton: How much I\\'m going to miss her. (He turns her into a human and she goes\\n  to meet Eric. They kiss which fades into kiss on wedding day. Everyone is\\n  happy. Sebastion is attacked by Louis. He beats Louis up and returns to the\\n  sea.)\\nSebastion: Yes, Thank you, thank you. (Ariel and Triton hug.)\\nAriel: I love you Daddy.\\n\\n     (Big finale while \"Part of Your World\" music plays. Ship sails off as\\nAriel and Eric kiss.)\\n\\nAll:     Now we can walk,\\n         Now we can run,\\n         Now we can stay all day in the sun.\\n         Just you and me,\\n         And I can be,\\n         Part of your world.\\n\\n                THE END\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------------'},\n",

[to Chi Fu] I\\'ll\\nexpect a full report in three weeks.\\n\\nChi Fu [to Shang]:  And I wont leave anything out.  [exits through the tent]\\n\\nShang [while tying his sword to his uniform]:  Captain Li Shang, Hmmm, leader of China\\'s finest troops.  No, the greatest troops of all time. \\nHeh, heh, heh, heh.  [Shang walks out of the tent to see the recruits fighting.  He stands stage left of Chi Fu and General Li.  Injured Recruit\\nsees the General and salutes him as he falls to the ground.  General Li steps over Injured Recruit and mounts his horse]\\n\\nChi Fu:  Most impressive.\\n\\nGeneral Li:  Good luck Captain.  [The general and his mounted troops leave the camp]\\n\\nShang [quietly, to himself]:  Good luck, Father.  [Shang looks at his troops and sighs]\\n\\nChi Fu [smirking, with board and brush in hand]:  Day one.\\n\\nShang [shouting]:  Soldiers!\\n\\nAll Recruits [backing away revealing Mulan and pointing at her.  Mulan is crouching in the fetal position on the ground]:  He started it!\\n\\n[Shang approaches Mulan and looks down over her.  Mulan looks up, sees Shang over top of her and gets up quickly dusting herself off]\\n\\nShang [to Mulan]:  I don\\'t need anyone causing trouble in my camp!\\n\\nMulan:  Sorry, [in her man voice] Uhh, I mean, sorry you had to see that.  [with her fist she taps Shang on the shoulder]  You know how it is\\nwhen you get those, uh [pounding her chest] manly urges and you just have to kill something [slapping her hand], fix things, uh, cook\\noutdoors.\\n\\nShang:  What\\'s your name?\\n\\nMulan [stumbling]:  Ahh, I, uhhh, I, uh--\\n\\nChi Fu [stepping into Mulan\\'s face]:  Your commanding officer just asked you a question.\\n\\nMulan:  Uhh, I\\'ve got a name.  Huh.  And it\\'s a boys name too.\\n\\nMushu [from the back of Mulan]:  Ling, How \\'bout Ling?\\n\\nMulan [to Mushu motioning with her head to Ling]:  His name\\'s Ling.\\n\\nShang:  I didn\\'t ask for his name.

[Takes the notice from Mulan]  Fa Zhou, *the* Fa Zhou?\\n\\nChi Fu:  I didn\\'t know Fa Zhou had a son.\\n\\nMulan:  Um, he...doesn\\'t talk about me much.  [Mulan tries to hawk up a loogie and spit but the saliva just runs from her mouth.  The\\nrecruits laugh]\\n\\nChi Fu:  I can see why, the boy\\'s an absolute lunatic.\\n\\nShang [to the recruits]: Okay gentlemen, thanks to your new friend Ping, you\\'ll spend tonight picking up every single grain of rice.  And\\ntomorrow, the real work begins.\\n\\n[All recruits growl at Mulan]\\n\\nMushu [Popping out the front of Mulan\\'s armor]:  You know, we have to work on your people skills.\\n\\n[Cut to Mulan sleeping in her tent.  Mushu winds up Cri-Kee\\'s wings.  Cri-Kee rings like an alarm clock]\\n\\nMushu: All right, rise and shine sleeping beauty.  [Mulan rises and blinks] C\\'mon [rapping on Mulan\\'s head with each syllable] hup, hup,\\nhup. [Mulan groans, lies back down and pulls the covers over her head.  Mushu pulls the covers off Mulan entirely]  Get your clothes on. \\nGet ready.  Got breakfast for ya.  [Mushu jumps onto Mulan\\'s knee with a bowl of porridge]  Look, you get porridge, and it\\'s happy to see\\nyou.  [Mushu shows her the bowl with two eggs and bacon looking like a smiley face.  Cri-Kee pops up out from the bowl of porridge] Hey,\\nget outta there, you gonna make people sick!  [Mushu uses chopsticks to push Cri-Kee out of the porridge]\\n\\nMulan:  Am I late?\\n\\nMushu [while feeding Mulan]:  No time to talk.  Now remember, it\\'s your first day of training so listen to your teacher and no fighting.  Play\\nnice with the other kids, unless of course one of the other kids wanna fight, then you have to kick the other kid\\'s butt.\\n\\nMulan [with her mouth full of food]:  But I don\\'t wanna kick the other kid\\'s butt.\\n\\nMushu:  Don\\'t talk with your mouth full.  Now let\\'s see your war face [Mulan looks at him with wide eyes and chipmunk cheeks full of food]. \\nI think my bunny slippers just ran for cover.  C\\'mon scare me, girl! \\n\\nMulan [swallows the food]:  Rrrrrrr!\\n\\nMushu [rolling back into the half eaten bowl of porridge]:  Oh, that\\'s my tough looking warrior.  That\\'s what I\\'m talking about.  Now get out\\nthere and make me proud. [Mushu ties up Mulan\\'s hair]\\n\\n[Khan whinnies and pokes his head into the tent]\\n\\nMushu:  What do you mean the troops just left?  \\n\\nMulan [acting surprised]:  They what!? [Mulan hurriedly puts on her clothes and jumps out of the tent going off to join the other recruits]  \\n\\nMushu [running out from the tent calling after Mulan]:  Wait, you forgot your sword.  My little baby off to destroy people [sniffle].\\n\\n[Cut to the troops muddling around near Shang\\'s tent]\\n\\nChi Fu [enters stage left]:  Order people, order!\\n\\nRecruit #2:  I\\'d like a pan fried noodle.\\n\\nChien-Po:  Oh, oh, sweet and pungent shrimp [Ling and others begin to laugh]\\n\\nRecruit #3:  Moo goo gai pan\\n\\nChi Fu:  That\\'s not funny.\\n\\n[Mulan comes running up to the group]\\n\\nLing [noticing Mulan\\'s arrival]:  Looks like our new friend slept in this morning.  [Mulan stops between Ling and Yao] [to Ping] Hellooo Ping,\\nAre you hungry?\\n\\nYao:  Yeah, \\'cause I owe you a knuckle sandwich.  [grabs Mulan by the shirt collar drawing back his other arm.  Mulan hides her face with\\nher hands.  Ling looks away, closes his eyes, and puts his fingers in his ears so that he wont hear anything]\\n\\nAll Soldiers [in agreement with Yao]:  Yeah.\\n\\nShang [loudly]:  Soldiers!  [The soldiers line up quicky.  Shang takes off his shirt and grabs a bow and quiver of arrows.  Mulan is duly\\nimpressed by Shang\\'s physique] You will assemble swiftly and silently every morning. [Shang walks down the line of soldiers] Anyone who\\nacts otherwise will answer to me.\\n\\nYao:  Ooooo, tough guy.\\n\\nShang [turning around with knocked arrow pointing towards Yao]:  Yao.  [All recruits take a step back leaving Yao one step forward.  Shang\\nPoints arrow skyward and shoots it into the top of a high pole]  Thank you for volunteering.  Retrieve the arrow.\\n\\nYao [bows to Shang]:  I\\'ll get that arrow pretty boy.  And I\\'ll do it with my shirt on.  [Yao prepares to leap onto that pole]\\n\\nShang:  One moment, you seem to be missing something.  [Chi Fu brings out two large bronze disks.  Shang takes out one disk and holds it\\nhigh speaking to all the troops]  This represents discipline  [Shang hands the weight to Yao and the weight falls to the ground taking Yao\\'s\\narm with it]  and this represents strength [Shang hands the other weight to Yao making him fall to the ground.  The troops laugh while\\nMulan looks concerned].  You need both to reach the arrow.\\n\\n[Yao climbs up the pole then slips down under the weight.  Ling, Chien-Po, and Mulan each take their turn and fall down.  Mulan rubs her\\nbehind as she walks away in front of Shang]\\n\\nShang:  We\\'ve got a long way to go.\\n\\n[Song I\\'ll Make a Man Out of You]\\n\\n[Shang throws staffs to the soldiers.  Yao intercepts Mulan\\'s staff and trips her with it]\\n\\nShang:\\nLet\\'s get down to business--\\nto defeat the Huns.\\n\\n[Shang throws up two clay pots and breaks them apart with his staff.  The troops are highly impressed]\\n\\nRecruits [putting their staffs out at arms length, spoken]:  Hua\\n\\nShang:\\nDid they send me daughters\\n when I asked for sons?  [Ling puts a cricket down Mulan\\'s back causing her to flail erratically]\\nYou\\'re the saddest bunch\\n I ever met  [Most soldiers fall as Mulan moves uncontrollably]\\nBut you can bet \\nbefore we\\'re through  [Shang does a somersault in the air landing near Mulan.  He takes a pole in the stomach.  Shang stops Mulan and\\ntakes her staff.  He grabs her by the collar]\\nMister, I\\'ll make a man\\n out of you \\n\\n[Shang steps on a lever throwing up 3 targets which he hits with 3 arrows from one bow]\\nTranquil as a forest\\n[The recruits try and fail.

The recruits fire stones at him which Shang deflect with the staff]\\nOnce you find your center\\nYou are sure to win\\n[Mulan wobbles with the bucket of water on her head.  As the recruits throw stones at her the bucket tips over onto her head]\\nYou\\'re a spineless, pale,\\npathetic lot \\nAnd you haven\\'t got a clue \\n[Shang throws his hand down into a river and retrieves a fish.  Mulan throws her hand down into the river and retrieve\\'s Yao\\'s foot.

With a punch to the face he knocks her back into a tree]\\n\\nMushu [from the tree acts as a boxing coach]:\\nThis guy\\'s got \\'em \\nscared to death\\n\\nMulan [Mushu pushes Mulan back out into the ring]:\\nHope he doesn\\'t see \\nright through me\\n\\nChien-Po [stops as he\\'s hopping across poles protruding from water causing Shang and the recruits to pile into him]:\\nNow I really wish that I \\nknew how to swim!\\n\\nShang and Chorus:  \\n[Cannon fire misses the target in the middle of an open field.

We\\'ll make better time to the Imperial City through the Tung Shao Pass.  We\\'re the only hope for the\\nEmperor now.  Move out!\\n\\n[Mulan looks at the sword, takes out the doll she found and places the doll at the base of the sword.  She turns around and joins the rest of\\nthe troops marching on]\\n\\n[Cut to Mulan standing next to Khan saddled to the cart with cannons.  A cannon blast shoots out of the cart and explodes in the air.  The\\ntroops look surprised.  Mulan glances back with a scowl into the hole in the canopy of the cart to see Mushu with a sorrowful face.  Mushu\\npoints at Cri-Kee.  Shang charges up to Mulan on his horse, Chi Fu right behind]\\n\\nShang [angrily]:  What happened?!\\n\\nMulan [stumbling]:  Uhhh--\\n\\nShang:  You just gave away our position.  Now we\\'re--[an arrow hits Shang in the shoulder as he falls to the ground.  Shang pulls out the\\narrow]  [calling out] Get out of range!!\\n\\n[The troops hurriedly run away as many arrows start falling all around them.  Mulan pulls Khan by the reins to hurry him up.  Fire arrows\\nstart hitting the cart with cannons attached to Khan.  The cart begins to blaze with fire]\\n\\nShang:  Save the cannons!\\n\\n[The troops form a human chain and start taking the cannons out of the burning cart one by one while Mulan steadies Khan to keep him\\nfrom bolting.  Chien-Po grabs many and hauls them on his own.  The troops grab]as many cannons as they safely can and Mulan cuts Khan\\nfree from the cart.  She mounts Khan and charges away from the fire.  The cart explodes sending Mulan flying off Khan losing her helmet\\nand sword which land near her.  Mushu and Cri-Kee, sent flying by the blast, scream and land near Mulan.\\n\\nMushu:  Oh sure, save the horse.\\n\\n[Mulan grabs Mushu with her right hand and grabs the sword with her left and runs to the troops position.  Cri-Kee and Khan follow.  Yao,\\nLing, Chien-Po and other recruits set up cannons against rocks.  They dodge a set of arrows that fall around them]\\n\\nShang:  Fire!\\n\\n[They launch a volley at the mountain where the archers are stationed.  As the cannon fire explodes, Shan-Yu\\'s army hides]\\n\\nShang:  Fire!\\n\\n[Mulan, Ling and Chien-Po launch a second volley at the mountain where the archers are stationed.  No more arrows can be seen coming\\nfrom the mountain position]\\n\\nShang:  Hold the last cannon.  [Yao poised to light his cannon, pauses.  Shan-Yu and his troops appear at the top of the mountain]  Prepare\\nto fight.  If we die, we die with honor.\\n\\n[Shan-Yu raises his sword high above his head and charges down the mountain at Shang\\'s position.  His falcon flies off his shoulder on\\nShan-Yu\\'s war cry  The Hun army follows]\\n\\nShang:  Yao, aim the cannon at Shan-Yu.\\n\\n[The line of Shang\\'s troops with Mulan at the end draw their swords.  Mulan looks down at her sword and sees the reflection of a large snow\\nembankment hanging to the side of a cliff.  She rushes forward]\\n\\nYao [being pushed aside by Mulan as she grabs the cannon]:  Hey.\\n \\nShang:  Ping, come back.  Ping!\\n\\n[Mulan charges forward towards the oncoming horde of the Hun army being led by Shan-Yu and his falcon.  Mushu looks over her at the\\noncoming horde with worry in his eyes]\\n\\nShang [starting to run after her waving his arms]:  Stop!\\n\\n[Mulan plants the cannon and aims it for the cliff with the snow overhang]\\n\\nMushu [seeing Shan-Yu riding closer to their position]:  All right, you might want to light that right about now.  Quickly!  Quickly!\\n\\n[Mulan takes out the flint and tries to light the fuse.  Shan-Yu\\'s falcon swoops buy knocking Mulan down scattering the flint rock]\\n\\nYao [speaking to Ling and Chien-Po]:  C\\'mon, we\\'ve gotta help.  [they charge towards Mulan\\'s position]\\n\\n[Mulan searches for the flint in the snow in vain.  She sees Mushu, grabs him and stretches him causing him to light the fuse.  Mushu lands\\non the cannon and the cannon fires off just above the charging Shan-Yu]\\n\\nMushu [tailing off as he rides the cannon toward the snow embankment]:  You missed him!  How could you miss?  He was three feet in\\nfront of you!\\n\\n[The cannon lodges in the snow and explodes causing the beginning of a large avalanche.  Mulan looks up with an evil grin on her face and\\nShan-Yu watches in horror as many of his troops begin to be swallowed up by the snow]\\n\\nShan-Yu [recollecting himself and focusing in on Mulan]:  Yrrrrrrraah.  \\n\\n[Shan-Yu swipes at Mulan with his sword hitting her in the right side.  Mulan falls back grabbing her right side.  Shan-Yu\\'s horse stumbles. \\nMulan uses this break to bolt away from the avalanche.  Shan-Yu gains his composure and starts to gallop away from the avalanche on his\\nhorse.  Shang looks with shock as hee sees the avalanche coming toward him.   Mulan grabs Shang as she passes by him, turning him\\naround and helping him run away from the avalanche]\\n\\nYao, Chien-Po and Ling [running towards the oncoming avalanche]:  Yeeahhhhhh!  [they stop.  noticing the oncoming avalanche they  turn\\naround and run back to where they came from]  Waaaaaaaaaa!\\n\\n[Khan jumps away from the troops position and starts to run towards Mulan passing Ling, Yao and Chien-Po. The avalanche swallows up\\nShan-Yu and his horse.  Khan arrives at Mulan\\'s position just ahead of the avalanche.  Mulan jumps onto Khan and reaches for Shang.  She\\ngrabs his hand, then the avalanche rushes forth breaking their grip, turning Khan around facing the oncoming avalanche of snow]\\n\\n[Cut to Ling, Yao and Chien-Po standing behind a rock.

[Mushu picks up Cri-Kee out of the snow]  Man, you are one lucky\\nbug.\\n\\n[Cut to Mulan riding Khan above the snow into the teeth of the avalanche.  Khan and Mulan are swept under by the snow and reemerge\\nquickly.  She looks back and sees Shang passed out riding the wave of snow]\\n\\nMulan [calling loudly]:  Shang, Shang!  [Mulan turns around and rides to Shang\\'s position.  She picks him up and places him on Khan.  She\\nturns Khan around again to be riding upstream]\\n\\n[Cut to Chien-Po with Ling standing on him and Yao standing on top of Ling]\\n\\nChien-Po:  Do you see them?\\n\\nYao [extatically]:  Yes!

[Yao\\'s arrow lands near by Mulan and she picks it up and starts to tie the rope to Khan]\\n\\nMushu [Getting off the shield and carrying Cri-Kee with him]:  Ooo, nice, very nice, you can sit by me.  [Mushu sees that they\\'re about to fall\\nover the cliff.  He and Cri-Kee look frightened] Ahhhhh!  We\\'re gonna die!  We\\'re gonna die!  I know we\\'re gonna die!  No way we can\\nsurvive this!  Death is coming! [Mulan knocks the arrow and shoots it toward Yao]\\n\\nYao [crying]:  I let them slip through my fingers. [Mulan\\'s arrow lands in Yao\\'s hands.  He grabs on and is pulled toward the cliff, the soldiers\\ngrab onto Yao and hold him steady near the cliff edge with the rope taught over the cliff]\\n\\nYao:  Pull\\n\\n[Chien-Po prays as he calmly walks up to the group of soldiers.  He lifts them all up and pulls backward hauling Mulan, Shang, Khan, Mushu\\nand Cri-Kee to safety]\\n\\nMushu:  I knew we could to it.  You da man. [Mulan looks pleased] Well sorta. [Mulan grimaces]\\n\\n[The soldiers help them up to the cliff]\\n\\nLing:  Step back guys, give \\'em some air.\\n\\nShang [catching his breath]:  Ping, you are the craziest man I\\'ve ever met.  And for that I owe you my life.  From now on, you have my trust.\\n[Mulan smiles big]\\n\\nLing:  Let\\'s hear it for Ping!  The bravest of us all.\\n\\nYao [lifting his arm high]:  You\\'re king of the mountain!\\n\\nChien-Po [jumping up and down]:  Yes, yes, yes!\\n\\nMulan [beginning to stand up]:  Ahhh, [she clutches her right side]\\n\\nShang:  Ping, what\\'s wrong?  [Mulan removes her hand slightly to show the blood on her hand and seeping through the armour] [loudly] \\nHe\\'s wounded, get help!  [Ping starts to pass out.  The images of Shang, Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po begin to fade as she loses consciousness] \\nPing, hold on.  Hold on.\\n\\n[Cut to outside of the medic tent.  Mulan and Medic are inside.  Shang stands by the entrance.  Yao, Ling and Chien-Po look quite\\nconcerned.  Ling drums his fingers on his knees.  The medic comes out from the tent and whispers to Shang.  Shang looks astonished and\\ngoes into the tent.  Mulan is lying down.  She opens her eyes, sees Shang and smiles at the sight of him.  She sits up allowing the blanket to\\nfall to her waist revealing her form fitting bandages on her chest.  She sees Shang\\'s surprised look and realizes her feminine form is\\nnoticeable]\\n\\nMulan [gasping as she covers up]: Huh,  I can explain.\\n\\nChi Fu [stepping into the tent]:  Huh?  So it\\'s true.\\n\\nMulan [calling after Shang as he steps out of the tent]:  Shang!\\n\\n[Cut to outside the tent.  Chi Fu hauls out Mulan by the arm.  Mulan uses her other hand to hold the blanket]\\n\\nChi Fu:  I knew there was something wrong with you.

Please believe me.\\n\\nChi Fu [to Shang]:  Hmph, Captain?\\n\\n[Shang walks over to Khan and takes the sword out of the scabbard attached to Khan.

[turns and walks towards the Imperial City]  Move out!\\n\\nChi Fu [coming up to Shang\\'s face]:  But you can\\'t just...\\n\\nShang [getting in Chi Fu\\'s face]:  I said, \"Move out!\"\\n\\n[The troops walk off toward the Imperial City leaving Mulan behind with Khan, Cri-Kee, and Mushu.  Mulan is sitting, shivering. Khan takes\\nhis blanket and wraps it around Mulan with his mouth and sits behind her.  Cri-Kee lights a fire with twigs.  When he doesn\\'t get warm, he\\nmoves under the blanket wrapped around Mulan.  Mushu walks toward Mulan carrying a stick]\\n\\nMushu:  I was this close, this close to impressing the ancestors, getting the top shelf, an entourage.  Man, all my fine work, ffft.  [Mushu picks\\nup a dumpling with his stick, slumps down in front of the fire Cri-Kee made and begins to cook the dumpling over the fire] [glancing up] Hi.\\n\\nMulan [look of sadness]:  I should never have left home.\\n\\nMushu:  Eh, come on, you wanted to save your father\\'s life.  Who knew you\\'d end up shaming him, disgracing your ancestors, and losing all\\nyour friends.  You know, you just gotta, you gotta learn to let these things go [looking as if he\\'s about to cry].\\n\\nMulan:  Maybe I didn\\'t go for my father.  Maybe what I really wanted was to prove I could do things right.  So when I looked in the mirror\\n[picking up her helmet and looking at her reflection in her helmet] I\\'d see someone worthwhile.  But I was wrong.  I see nothing.  [throws the\\nhelmet down and a tear runs down her cheek]\\n\\nMushu [picking up the helmet and spitting on it]:  Well that\\'s because this just needs a little spit, that\\'s all.  Let me shine this up for ya [wiping\\nthe spit to clean the helmet and holding it up to Mulan].   I can see you, look at you, you look so pretty.  [seeing Mulan is not cheered up by\\nhis actions, he shows sorrow on his face]  The truth is we\\'re both frauds.  Your ancestors never sent me, they don\\'t even like me.  I mean,\\nyou risked your life to help people you love.  I risked your life to help myself.  At least you had good intentions  [Mulan smiles].\\n\\nCri-Kee [jumping on top of the helmet beginning to bawl]:  Chirp, Chirp, Chirp.  Bawl, Bawl.\\n\\nMushu:  What!?  What do you mean you\\'re not lucky?  You lied to me?  [Cri-Kee nods] [to Khan]  And what are you? A sheep?\\n\\nMulan [sadly]:  I\\'ll have to face my father sooner or later.  Let\\'s go home.\\n\\nMushu:  Yeah, this ain\\'t gonna be pretty.  But, don\\'t you worry, \\'kay?  Things\\'ll work out.  We started this thing together and that\\'s how we\\'ll\\nfinish.

Shan-Yu breaks\\nthrough the roof behind Mulan surprising her.  Mulan backs away and searches for something on her\\nperson to help her against Shan-Yu.  She finds a her fan, takes it out, and opens it]\\n\\nShan-Yu:  It looks like you\\'re out of ideas.\\n\\n[Shan-Yu lunges with his sword.  Mulan dodges to her right and lets the sword go right through\\nthe fan.  She closes the fan back up on the sword and twists the fan with both hands so that\\nShan-Yu loses his grip.  The sword flies toward Mulan and she catches it by the handle slipping\\noff the fan with her sword movement]\\n\\nMulan:  Not quite.  [calling out]  Ready, Mushu?\\n\\nMushu [behind Shan-Yu tied to a large rocket firework]:  I am ready, baby. [He blows fire onto a\\nstick and hands the stick to Cri-Kee who\\'s standing on the firework]  Light me!  [Cri-Kee lights\\nthe fuse]\\n\\n[Shan-Yu approaches Mulan.  Using the sword as a lever, Mulan lunges at Shan-Yu kicking him in\\nthe face then sweep kicks him and he falls to the ground.  Mulan picks the sword back up and\\nstabs it into Shan-Yu\\'s cape.  The rocket on Mushu ignites and hurls him toward Shan-Yu.  Mulan\\nlies flat down on the left side of the roof.  Shan-Yu sees the approaching rocket and tries to\\nrun, but the sword has him pinned to the spot.  The rocket hits Shan-Yu square in the belly\\npropelling him toward the firework tower.  Mushu grabbed onto the sword as he went by letting the\\nrocket do the work.  Cri-Kee hangs on to Mushu\\'s tail.  Mulan jumps back up to the crest of the\\nroof and runs away from the fireworks tower grabbing Mushu and Cri-Kee off the sword]\\n\\nMulan [while running]:  Get off the roof, get off the roof, get off the roof.\\n\\n[The rocket rides Shan-Yu into the fireworks tower causing masses of explosions and fireworks to\\nfly everywhere.  Mulan jumps near the edge of the roof.  Propelled by the explosion, she grabs\\nonto a lantern that is hanging on a taught rope and starts to slide down.  She looks down and\\nreleases her grip so that she lands on the back of Shang causing the two of them to fall to the\\nground.  Shan-Yu\\'s sword follows and lands on the ground near by]\\n\\nMushu [landing and flying backwards on his butt a couple of times pointing at the fireworks]:  Ah\\nha ha ha ha.  [Mushu\\'s catches Cri-Kee with antenna on fire as Cri-Kee falls toward him] [to\\nCri-Kee]  You are a lucky bug. [Mushu pinches out the fire on Cri-Kee\\'s antenna]\\n\\nChi Fu [walking down the stairs in a tattered outfit and slightly burned]:  That was a deliberate\\nattempt on my life.  Where is she?  Now she\\'s done it.  What a mess.  [Shang and troops push\\nMulan behind them to protect her] [to Shang] Stand aside, that creature\\'s not worth protecting.\\n\\nShang [in Chi Fu\\'s face]:  She\\'s a hero.\\n\\nChi Fu:  \\'Tis a woman.  She will never be worth anything.\\n\\nShang [grabbing Chi Fu by the shirt collar]:  Listen, you pompous--\\n\\nEmperor [walking down the steps]:  That is enough!\\n\\nShang:  Your Majesty, I can explain.\\n\\n[The Emperor motions for Shang to stand aside.  Shang and his men part giving the Emperor a clear\\npath to Mulan.  Mulan steps forward and bows before the Emperor.  Chi Fu with a sinister look\\nwaits to write down the words of the Emperor]\\n\\nEmperor:  I\\'ve heard a great deal about you, Fa Mulan.  You stole your father\\'s armor, ran away\\nfrom home, impersonated a soldier, deceived your commanding officer, dishonored the Chinese army,\\ndestroyed my palace, AND...you have saved us all.  [the Emperor bows to Mulan]\\n\\n[Chi Fu looks at the Emperor actions astonishingly then immediately falls prostrate before Mulan. \\nShang, Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po follow suit.  Mulan looks up then turns around hardly believing\\nwhat she sees as the entire Chinese population within the palace grounds fall prostrate on the\\nground in a wave like pattern, bowing to her.  Khan bows with Mushu and Cri-Kee on his back]\\n\\nMushu:  My little baby\\'s all grown up and savin\\' China.  [to Cri-Kee] You have a tissue?\\n\\nEmperor:  Chi Fu,\\n\\nChi Fu:  Your Excellency?\\n\\nEmperor:  See to it that this woman is made a member of my council.\\n\\nChi Fu [muttering to himself]:  A member of your coun...[realizing what the Emperor has said]\\nwhat? [stutters] But there are no council positions open, your Majesty.\\n\\nEmperor [to Mulan]:  Very well then, you can have his job [pointing out Chi Fu].\\n\\nChi Fu [wobbling to and fro]:  What?...My...[faints]\\n\\nMulan [smiles big then turns to the Emperor and bows]:  With all due respect, your Excellency.  I\\nhave been away from home long enough.\\n\\nEmperor [taking off his pendant]:  Then take this, so your family will know what you have done\\nfor me.  And this [handing her the sword of Shan-Yu]  so the world will know what you have done\\nfor China.\\n\\n[Mulan takes the gifts and hugs the Emperor]\\n\\nYao:  Is she allowed to do that?  [Shang, Ling, and Chien-Po shrug]\\n\\n[Mulan walks away from the Emperor and is embraced by Yao and Ling.  Chien-Po comes up and lifts\\nall three of them off the ground in a big bear hug.  Chien-Po lets them all back to the ground\\nagain.  Mulan walks toward Shang and stops in front of him.  As Shang begins to speak Mulan\\nstarts to smile anticipating something good]\\n\\nShang:  Um...[Mulan grins]  You... [Mulan smiles] You fight good.\\n\\nMulan [smile turning into disappointment]:  Oh, thank you.  [Mulan walks toward Khan]\\n\\nShang: [turning toward Mulan and grunts with disappointment in himself]:  Hmm.\\n\\n[Mulan mounts Khan]\\n\\nMulan:  Khan, let\\'s go home.\\n\\n[Khan jumps down the steps and gallops on the flat parts of the stair case back down to ground\\nlevel.  The crowd cheers al the while.  The Emperor approaches Shang and clears his throat]\\n\\nEmperor [to Shang]:  The flower that blooms in adversity is the most rare and beautiful of all.\\n\\nShang [dumbfounded]:  Sir?\\n\\nEmperor:  You don\\'t meet a girl like that ev\\'ry dynasty.  [The emperor puts on his hat and walks\\nback up the steps to his palace]\\n\\n[Cut to Mulan\\'s home, her father is sitting beneath the blossom tree.   A blossom falls and lands\\non his leg.  Mulan appears at the threshold and moves toward her father.  Fa Zhou sees her\\napproaching and starts to stand]\\n\\nFa Zhou:  Mulan.  \\n\\n[Mulan quickly moves in front of her father and kneels causing him to sit back down]\\n\\nMulan:  Father, I brought you the sword of Shan-Yu [hands the sword to Fa Zhou] and the crest of\\nthe Emperor [hands the crest to Fa Zhou].  [with head bowed] They\\'re gifts to honor the Fa\\nFamily.\\n\\n[Fa Zhou takes the gifts and throws them down to the ground beside him to the surprise of Mulan. \\nHe bends down and holds her arms outstretched]\\n\\nFa Zhou:  The greatest gift and honor, is having you for a daughter.  [Fa Zhou wipes away Mulan\\'s\\ntear then hugs Mulan]  I\\'ve missed you so.\\n\\nMulan:  I\\'ve missed you too Baba.\\n\\n[Fa li and Grandma Fa watch from the doorway]\\n\\nFa Li [sighing]:  Ahhhhh\\n\\nGrandma Fa:  Great, she brings home a sword.  If you ask me she should have brought home a\\nma--[leaving her mouth open when she sees Shang]\\n\\nShang [just arriving]:  Excuse me, does Fa Mulan live here?\\n\\n[Grandma Fa\\'s mouth stays open as she and Fa Li point toward Mulan\\'s position.  Shang walks\\ntoward Mulan and Fa Zhou]\\n\\nGrandma Fa:  Woo, sign me up for the next war.\\n\\n[Shang approaches seeing Fa Zhou]\\n\\nShang [bows before Fa Zhou and speaks confidently]:  Honorable Fa Zhou I--Mulan [Mulan steps up. \\nShang sees her and speaks insecurely] Uh...Uh...You forgot your helmet.  Ah but well, actually\\nit\\'s your helmet, isn\\'t it?...[handing the helmet toward Fa Zhou] I mean...\\n\\n[Fa Zhou motions with his head for Mulan to take over.  Mulan holds the helmet Shang offers]\\n\\nMulan:  Would you like to stay for dinner?\\n\\nGrandma Fa [speaking from stage right]:  Would you like to stay forever? [Mulan shakes her head with a\\nsmile at Grandma Fa\\'s statement]\\n\\nShang [reassuredly to Mulan]:  Dinner would be great.\\n\\n[Cut to First Ancestor grinning happily looking at the scene through the temple window.  He watches Mulan hand the helmet back to Fa\\nZhou.  Mushu climbs up to the window sill by First Ancestor\\'s his head]\\n\\nMushu [tugging on First Ancestor\\'s ear]:  C\\'mon, who did a good job?

The spotlight hits Christy, who wears a \\n     high beehive wig and a sequinned, early Supremes-style \\n     gown.  Michelle and Tina wear matching gowns and wigs.

While Christy does her best, her singing voice is \\n     not on a par with those of the other Ronelles.\\n\\n     The lounge itself is practically empty, except for a few \\n     drunken Shriners and a couple of college kids.  POLICE \\n     LIEUTENANT EDDIE MULCAHY sits at a ringside table with his \\n     eyes locked on Christy.  An easygoing charmer, Eddie gives \\n     her a wink, but she responds with an up-yours look and a \\n     turn to the other half of the room as the song continues.\\n\\n     INT. DRESSING ROOM - LATER\\n\\n     A small, cramped room with cracked plaster walls and a \\n     sputtering fan for ventilation.  Christy has her own \\n     dressing table and mirror, and the Ronelles share a table a \\n     few feet away.  Clothing and costumes hang on nails or are \\n     draped over chairs as the girls change into street wear.\\n\\n                               CHRISTY\\n               Screw this dump.  It\\'s a roach motel \\n               with sequins.

You\\'re holding me back, \\n               just like Vince!  I should be headlining!\\n\\n     A pock-faced weasel of a man named JOEY opens the door and \\n     leans into the room.\\n\\n                               CHRISTY\\n               What do you want?

Hit \\n               the road.\\n\\n     Joey takes a step into the room and sets a box on the \\n     chair near Christy.\\n\\n                               JOEY\\n               From Vince.\\n\\n     Page 8.\\n\\n                               CHRISTY\\n               His ashes?\\n\\n                               JOEY\\n               With love.\\n\\n     Joey leaves.  Michelle and Tina hover around the box, very \\n     excited.  They pick it up, trying to tempt Christy.\\n\\n                               MICHELLE\\n               From Vince!

Inside is \\n               a rather gaudy fur coat.  Michelle and \\n               Tina are impressed.\\n\\n                               MICHELLE\\n               It\\'s a fur!\\n\\n                               TINA\\n               It\\'s new!\\n\\n                               CHRISTY\\n               It\\'s a bribe.

Again.\\n\\n     Christy reaches for the doorknob, without looking at the \\n     door.  She fumbles a bit.  She finds the door.\\n\\n                               CHRISTY\\n               Mink.  Wow.\\n\\n     Christy walks backwards, out the door.

RECEPTION AREA\\n\\n     Christy, clearly terrified, is walking quickly away from \\n     Vince\\'s office.  She passes through a glass door which \\n     leads to the cubicle area.\\n\\n     LONG SHOT of the cubicle area, which resembles a darkened \\n     maze.  Christy hears Joey approaching; she runs into the \\n     cubicle area.\\n\\n                               JOEY\\n               Christy?  He only wants to talk to you!\\n\\n     Page 14.\\n\\n     ANGLE on Christy, crouched behind a half-wall.  She is \\n     clutching the coat.\\n\\n                               WILLY\\n               Christy?\\n\\n     There is a stuffed toy, a \"Garfield the Cat,\" attached to \\n     the wall near Christy, with suction cups.  Christy tries to \\n     pull the cat\\'s feet off the wall, very quietly.\\n\\n                               JOEY\\n               Christy?\\n\\n     Christy finally just yanks the cat off the wall.  She \\n     hurls it as high and as far as she can, to the opposite end \\n     of the room.\\n\\n     ANGLE on the flying stuffed cat.\\n\\n     Joey sees the blur of the cat; he SHOOTS it, and the cat \\n     explodes.\\n\\n                               JOEY\\n               Come on, Christy!  There\\'s no place to \\n               go!\\n\\n     Christy steadies herself against a Xerox machine.  She \\n     accidentally activates the machine, which lights up and \\n     starts HUMMING.\\n\\n     ANGLE on Willy, as he hears the Xerox machine.  He quickly \\n     moves toward the SOUND.\\n\\n     Willy reaches the Xerox machine; the area is deserted.  He \\n     starts moving quickly down the aisle   A chair, the kind on \\n     casters, comes rolling out of one of the cubicle doorways; \\n     the chair hits Willy and he falls.\\n\\n     Christy runs out of the cubicle; Willy is on the floor, \\n     struggling to get up.  As Christy sprints away, Willy \\n     SHOOTS at her.  He misses, but a glass partition SHATTERS.\\n\\n     Christy runs for an open elevator, but it has been \\n     summoned from another floor and the doors are beginning to \\n     close. She runs even faster.  A BULLET whistles past her \\n     ear and hits the back wall of the elevator.  She reaches \\n     for the doors a moment too late, and the elevator is gone.\\n\\n     Christy scrambles to the door beside the elevator and runs \\n     into a stairwell as two more BULLETS bite pieces out of the \\n     door.\\n\\n     INT. STAIRWELL\\n\\n     Taking the stairs three at a time, Christy is flying, \\n     still clutching the mink.  The thugs are gaining on her.  A \\n     BULLET hits metal and RICOCHETS off several walls and \\n     steps.\\n\\n     Page 15.\\n\\n     At the next landing, Christy opens the door and ducks into \\n     a corridor.\\n\\n     INT. CORRIDOR\\n\\n     Exhausted but powered by adrenaline, Christy sprints past \\n     doors to the end of the hall, still with the mink.  Joey \\n     appears from the stairwell just as Christy ducks into a \\n     supply room.\\n\\n     INT. SUPPLY ROOM\\n\\n     Christy shoves a cleaning cart aside and wades through a \\n     pile of dirty linen.  Joey opens the door just as Christy \\n     dives head first into the laundry chute.\\n\\n     INT. LAUNDRY CHUTE\\n\\n     Christy, lying atop the mink, flies through the chute like \\n     a subway train through a tunnel.\\n\\n     INT. BASEMENT\\n\\n     The chute spits Christy out like a bullet into a huge bin \\n     of dirty linen.  Two workers glance around as they load \\n     large washing machines with laundry.  Christy climbs out of \\n     the bin and dashes for a door.  Working in a hotel, the \\n     workers have seen everything.\\n\\n     INT. LAUNDRY CHUTE\\n\\n     Joey flies through the chute.\\n\\n     INT. BASEMENT\\n\\n     Joey suddenly flies into the bin.  He climbs out with his \\n     gun in sight.\\n\\n                               JOEY\\n               Which way?\\n\\n     The workers point to the door, and Joey rushes across the \\n     room.  One of the workers is now wearing the mink coat.\\n\\n     EXT. STREET - NIGHT\\n\\n     Joey comes out of the hotel and finds an empty street.  He \\n     looks in every direction, but the nearby streets have \\n     swallowed Christy into safety for the moment.\\n\\n     EXT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT\\n\\n     The central offices of the Las Vegas Police Department.\\n\\n     INT.

STAINED CLASS WINDOW - DAY\\n\\n     Jesus delivers the Sermon on the Mount in vibrant red, \\n     blue and green stained glass.  An ORGAN plays a hymn -- \\n     badly.  Notes are missed, skipped over and mutilated.\\n\\n     PAN DOWN to a procession of nuns who march into a chapel \\n     at the ancient St. Katherine\\'s Convent.  The organ isn\\'t \\n     getting any better, and we see it is being played by SISTER \\n     ALMA, a seventy-year-old nun with arthritis and a hearing \\n     aid.  Apparently the hearing aid is malfunctioning, because \\n     Sister Alma doesn\\'t seem to realize how badly she\\'s \\n     playing.\\n\\n     As the last nun in the procession enters the chapel, she \\n     closes the door behind her.  Across the lobby, the front \\n     door opens and Eddie enters with a very reluctant Christy.\\n\\n                               CHRISTY\\n                             (to Eddie)\\n               I hate you.

You think \\n               Vince would look for you here?\\n\\n     As Christy looks around the lobby, various religious \\n     artifacts loom at her; we see them from her terrified P0V. \\n     ANGLE on a crucifix, casting an ominous shadow, a stack of \\n     hymnals, and a large, framed Sunday School-style portrait \\n     of St. Katherine.  Christy shudders.\\n\\n                               CHRISTY\\n               Nuns, Eddie.  There are nuns here. \\n               Everywhere.

MOTHER SUPERIOR\\'S OFFICE\\n\\n     The office is bare and austere.  MOTHER SUPERIOR sits at \\n     her desk with her hands folded.  Like all the nuns at the \\n     convent, she wears the traditional full-length habit and \\n     wimple.\\n\\n     Mother Superior is in total command of all she surveys, \\n     and she seldom raises her voice or her blood pressure as \\n     she rules.  Control is her passion; within the walls of the \\n     convent, she has created a world she can trust because it\\'s \\n     a world she controls.\\n\\n               But Mother Superior is not in control at \\n               this particular moment.

Christy decides that she will try and make Sister \\n     Mary  Robert talk.  She picks up the carrot and tosses it \\n     at Mary Robert.  Mary Robert jumps.  She waggles a finger \\n     at Christy, scolding her.  Mary Robert resumes hoeing.\\n\\n     Page 31.\\n\\n     Christy is now determined.  She takes her hoe, and tiptoes \\n     nearer to Mary Robert.  Very gently, she uses the handle of \\n     the floe to lift Mary Robert\\'s skirt, and gooses her.\\n\\n     Mary Robert vips, very loudly.  All the other nuns turn \\n     and stare at Mary Robert, scolding her.  Christy waggles \\n     her finger at Mary Robert, scolding her.\\n\\n     Christy, giggling to herself, resumes hoeing.

Out \\n               in the woods.  It wasn\\'t all modern, like \\n               here.  No electricity.  Cold water. Bare \\n               feet.  Those were nuns.  It was Hell on \\n               earth, but I loved it.  This place is a \\n               Hilton.\\n\\n     INT. BATHING ROOM\\n\\n     A stone room that is very medieval-looking.  One wall is \\n     divided into stalls by wooden partitions.  In each stall is \\n     a nun, standing beneath a crude shower head that releases a \\n     thin stream of lukewarm water.  We see only the nuns\\' heads \\n     and shoulders.\\n\\n     Still sleepy, Christy leans against the wall of her stall, \\n     her eyes closed.  Lost in thought, she begins singing \\n     softly to herself.\\n\\n     Page 35.\\n\\n                               CHRISTY\\n               MY BOYFRIEND\\'S BACK\\n               AND YOU\\'RE GONNA BE IN TROUBLE\\n\\n                               A FEW OTHER NUNS\\n                             (very softly)\\n               HEY-LA, HEY-LA\\n\\n     Christy looks up from her reverie; she looks around.

CHAPEL - A FEW MINUTES LATER\\n\\n     Bishop O\\'Hara is leading the Sunday mass.  He stands in \\n     the pulpit.  The choir nuns stand in a fenced-in area to \\n     his left.  The remaining nuns, including Christy and Mother \\n     Superior, sit in the first few pews.\\n\\n                               O\\'HARA\\n               We are a small congregation this \\n               morning.  Too many mornings.  Something \\n               has gone terribly wrong.   Where is \\n               faith?  Where is celebration?  Where is \\n               everyone?  Still, rather than regret the \\n               absence of our neighbors, let us rejoice \\n               in the fellowship of those present.  Our \\n               choirmistress, Sister Mary Lazarus, has \\n               informed me that our choir, while always \\n               superior, has been toiling especially \\n               hard on this week\\'s selection.  Sister?\\n\\n     Mary Lazarus raises her hand, and the choir begins \\n     singing. They sing a traditional hymn, \"Let Thy Thoughts Be \\n     Guided.\" As always, their singing is dreadful; they have no \\n     tempo or pitch, and the hymn becomes an off-key drone.\\n\\n     As the hymn continues, the CAMERA PANS OVER the chapel. \\n     Aside from the nuns, it is almost empty; only a few elderly \\n     people are in attendance.\\n\\n     ANGLE ON CHRISTY\\n\\n     sitting with the other nuns.  She is clearly about to fall \\n     asleep.  Then the choir hits a particularly horrendous \\n     note, and Christy jerks awake.  She immediately tries to \\n     assume a pious expression, tilting her head and folding her \\n     hands in prayer; she looks like a somewhat demented Sunday \\n     School calendar.\\n\\n     EXT.

CONVENT SCHOOLROOM - AN HOUR LATER\\n\\n     A plain whitewashed classroom, with battered student-style \\n     desks.  A group of about eight local TEENAGE GIRLS has \\n     gathered.

Christy sits at the \\n     loom, and waves as Mother Superior and Mary Patrick exit.\\n\\n     Christy stares at the loom; a look of horror crosses her \\n     face.  She has not been paying attention to Mary Patrick\\'s \\n     instructions.  She cracks her knuckles, as if she were \\n     about to play the piano.  She grabs two parts of the loom, \\n     at random.  She moves these parts.\\n\\n     ANGLE on the loom.  As a result of Christy\\'s movements, \\n     the loom collapses, piece by piece.  The tapestry unravels, \\n     the many skeins of wool snap, and the mechanical apparatus \\n     disintegrates, until finally the entire loom shudders and \\n     falls to the floor, as Christy watches, aghast.\\n\\n     INT.

We can call the \\n               Enquirer.\\n\\n                               MARY ROBERT\\n               No, you don\\'t understand -- I don\\'t want \\n               to get out!

Why not?\\n\\n                               MARY ROBERT\\n               She says I should wait.  She says that \\n               no one should become a nun as an escape \\n               from life.  She says that I\\'m not \\n               experienced enough to make the decision \\n               yet.  In a mature manner.\\n\\n                               CHRISTY\\n               She said that?  Reverend Mother?\\n\\n     Mary Robert nods, solemnly.  Suddenly, from the streets \\n     outside the convent, we hear a BLAST OF hot dance MUSIC, \\n     and the SOUND of laughter and carefree conversation.\\n\\n                               CHRISTY\\n               Well, then there\\'s only one thing to do.\\n\\n                               MARY ROBERT\\n               What?\\n\\n                               CHRISTY\\n               Reverend Mother says you need \\n               experience, right, in life.  In order to \\n               make a responsible decision.  This is \\n               going to be very painful for me.  You \\n               know how much I love this little room. \\n               This whole convent.  Wait.\\n\\n     Christy stands, and goes to the crucifix hanging on the \\n     wall.  She speaks to the crucifix, and listens, as if Jesus \\n     is advising her.\\n\\n     Page 50.\\n\\n                               CHRISTY\\n                             (to Jesus)\\n               Must I do this thing, 0 Lord?

STREET\\n\\n     The outer wall of the convent.  A door swings open, and \\n     Christy sticks her head out.  She looks both ways, and \\n     steps outside.  She beckons to Mary Robert, who appears \\n     from behind her.  Mary Robert looks very wary.  Christy \\n     pulls her along.\\n\\n     EXT. A STREET NEARBY\\n\\n     Christy and Mary Robert walk along a street a few blocks \\n     from the convent.\\n\\n                               MARY ROBERT\\n                             (looking around \\n                             cautiously)\\n               Are you sure this is what Reverend \\n               Mother had in mind?\\n\\n     Page 51.\\n\\n                               CHRISTY\\n               I know it is.

SOCIAL CLUB\\n\\n     A neighborhood hang-out, the windows bright with neon beer \\n     signs.  The exterior is colorfully painted; the club all \\n     but explodes with good times.  A group of teenagers lounge \\n     on the steps, sipping beers and smoking.  Among the \\n     teenagers are the girls from Christy\\'s Christian Youth \\n     group.  Christy and Mary Robert approach, and the group \\n     falls silent.\\n\\n                               CHRISTY\\n               How are you doing.\\n\\n                               LAWANDA\\n                             (puzzled)\\n               Hey, Sisters.

The atmosphere is a combination of hazy \\n     darkness and colored lights; the club should have the \\n     feeling of a hot neighborhood party, with people of all \\n     ages and races.  The MUSIC percolates, and Christy starts \\n     to move to it.  She and Mary Robert find a table in the \\n     corner, and signal a nearby waitress.\\n\\n                               CHRISTY\\n               A couple of bowls of chili.\\n                             (holding up the beer)\\n               And another round of these.\\n\\n     The waitress looks at the two women strangely; the club \\n     has never hosted nuns before.\\n\\n                               MARY ROBERT\\n                             (to the waitress, \\n                             confidentially)\\n               I have to do this.

Christy and Mary \\n     Robert watch the action at the club.\\n\\n     Across the room, MIKE the bartender stares at the nuns, \\n     especially Christy; he tries to place her.\\n\\n                               MARY ROBERT\\n               Who are all these people?\\n\\n                               CHRISTY\\n               This is your neighborhood.

He takes out a copy of Vince\\'s fax \\n     photo and stares at it.  He covers Christy\\'s hair in the \\n     photo with his hands, creating a wimple.  There is no \\n     question in his mind; the two are the same.  Mike has a \\n     dangerous look in his eyes as he takes a gun from the \\n     drawer and slips it into his pocket beneath his apron.\\n\\n     There is a LIVE BAND on a small stage at one end of the \\n     club.  They start playing a hot dance number, and the club \\n     really begins to cook, as the dance floor fills.  Christy \\n     and Mary Robert, both still seated, start to move with the \\n     music.\\n\\n     A very good-looking LOCAL DUDE comes over to the nuns \\n     table.

I mean, nothing really \\n               happened.  We just... took a walk.\\n\\n     The car\\'s bright lights suddenly switch on, and the nuns \\n     turn, startled.  The car hurtles toward them.  They scream, \\n     and Christy grabs Mary Robert and throws her out of the \\n     car\\'s path; the two women land on a pile of garbage bags.\\n\\n     Struggling to her feet, Christy sees the car go into \\n     reverse, and then pull forward again.  She sees a glint of \\n     light reflect off a gun as the car\\'s driver (Mike the \\n     bartender) leans out the window.\\n\\n                               CHRISTY\\n                             (to Mary Robert)\\n               Run!\\n\\n     Christy shoves Mary Robert towards an alley.  As she does \\n     so, the gun GOES OFF with a red flash.  The shot misses the \\n     two women and SHATTERS a plate glass window of the store \\n     behind them.\\n\\n     EXT. ALLEY\\n\\n     Running up the alley, Christy and Mary Robert hear Mike\\'s \\n     FOOTSTEPS chasing them, growing louder as he gains on them.\\n\\n                               MARY ROBERT\\n               Mary Clarence! \\n\\n                               CHRISTY\\n               Keep moving!\\n\\n     Christy grabs the ladder of a fire escape, and shoves Mary \\n     Robert up the ladder ahead of her.\\n\\n                               CHRISTY\\n               Climb!  Now!\\n\\n     As Christy and Mary Robert climb the fire escape, another \\n     GUNSHOT ECHOES in the alley, ricocheting off the fire \\n     escape.\\n\\n     The nuns climb higher up the building.  Mike pursues, \\n     looking for a shot between the steps and the landings, but \\n     not finding any openings.  He takes the steps two at a time \\n     and begins to gain ground.\\n\\n     At the fourth floor landing, Christy\\'s heel gets stuck in \\n     the grating.  She pulls frantically at the laces.\\n\\n     Page 56.\\n\\n                               CHRISTY\\n               Goddamn it!\\n\\n                               MARY ROBERT\\n               Mary Clarence!\\n\\n     Mike arrives at the landing just as Christy twists her \\n     toot out of the shoe, and surprises him with a lunge for \\n     the gun.  Mike\\'s hand is knocked back against the metal \\n     frame of the fire escape, and the gun flies loose, RATTLING \\n     down the metal steps to the landing below.  Christy shoves \\n     Mary Robert into the open window of an apartment, and \\n     follows her in.\\n\\n     INT. TENEMENT APARTMENT\\n\\n     Christy and Mary Robert leap into the bedroom of an \\n     Hispanic couple, their arms wrapped around each other in \\n     bed.  At the women\\'s entrance, the couple looks up, stunned \\n     to see two nuns in their bedroom.\\n\\n                               MARY ROBERT\\n               Oh my Lord!\\n\\n                               CHRISTY\\n                             (pushing Mary Robert \\n                             forward)\\n               Experience!\\n\\n     The couple continues to look stunned as the nuns race out \\n     of the room.\\n\\n     EXT.

Mother Superior sits up with a \\n     stiffened back and a severe expression.\\n\\n     As the chord grows in force, Christy gives the choir a \\n     beat.\\n\\n                               CHRISTY\\n               One, two, three...\\n\\n     The choir begins a radically new version of the same hymn. \\n     Christy strides up and down in front of the choir, \\n     transforming the song into a rousing gospel anthem, with a \\n     passionate call-and-response format.\\n\\n                               CHOIR\\n               LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED\\n\\n                               CHRISTY\\n               What you say?\\n\\n                               CHOIR\\n               LET THY SOUL BE HEALED\\n\\n     Page 69.\\n\\n                               CHRISTY\\n               But how?\\n\\n                               CHOIR\\n               BY A VOICE YOU HEAR FROM ON HIGH\\n\\n                               CHRISTY\\n               I think I hear it!\\n\\n                               CHOIR\\n               LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED\\n\\n                               CHRISTY\\n               You know, I just might!\\n\\n                               CHOIR\\n               LET THY SOUL BE HEALED\\n\\n                               CHRISTY AND CHOIR \\n               LET THY SPIRIT TAKE WING AND FLY!\\n\\n     Spontaneous reactions from everyone in the church.\\n\\n     EXT. STREET\\n\\n     The gorgeous, exciting MUSIC pours into the street.  \\n     Everyone turns to look.  Windows open and people glance \\n     out. The street takes on a new movement.\\n\\n     INT. CHAPEL\\n\\n     The choir really lets loose flow.\\n\\n                               CHRISTY AND CHOIR\\n               LET THY THOUGHTS BE STRENGTHENED\\n               LET THY PRAYERS BE HEARD\\n               LET OUR LORD REJOICE IN YOUR PRAISE\\n               LET HIS GOODNESS LIFT YOU TO A HIGHER \\n               PLACE\\n               AND LET LOVE AND PEACE FILL YOUR DAYS\\n\\n     Lawanda and her friends peer in at the back door of the \\n     chapel.  Bishop O\\'Hara sees them, and beckons them to come \\n     in.\\n\\n                               CHRISTY\\n               Sister Alma!\\n\\n     Sister Alma, inspired by Christy and the choir, burns up \\n     the organ with a solo.  More people from the street begin \\n     to enter; tentative, curious, drawn by the music.\\n\\n     At the end of the solo, Christy makes a gesture to the \\n     choir, and each member produces a tambourine.  The chapel \\n     is full of energy, music and life.\\n\\n                               CHRISTY\\n               Mary Robert!\\n\\n     Page 70.\\n\\n     Mary Robert sings, really letting the power of her voice \\n     ring out.

Mother \\n     Superior is aghast.\\n\\n     The choir builds to a huge gospel finish, all keeping \\n     their eyes on Christy.\\n\\n                               CHOIR\\n               LET THY SPIRIT\\n\\n                               CHRISTY\\n               You know what we\\'re saying!\\n\\n                               CHOIR\\n               LET THY SPIRIT\\n\\n                               CHRISTY\\n               I think they hear you!\\n\\n                               MARY LAZARUS\\n               LET THY SPIRIT\\n\\n                               CHRISTY AND CHOIR\\n               LET THY SPIRIT TAKE WING AND FLYI\\n\\n     After the final note, everyone in the chapel is \\n     exhilarated -- everyone except Mother Superior.  Christy \\n     looks out at the congregation that has increased by a dozen \\n     or more, including Lawanda and her friends.  Christy looks \\n     happier than she has in years.\\n\\n     INT. CORRIDOR - DAY\\n\\n     The members of the choir are all gathered outside Mother \\n     Superior\\'s office, leaning close to the door and listening \\n     to her harangue Christy.  They are surprised to find \\n     themselves joined suddenly by Bishop O\\'Hara, and part to \\n     let him through.  He leans down to the keyhole and listens.\\n\\n     INT.

Pack \\n               the joint.\\n\\n                               MOTHER SUPERIOR\\n               Through blasphemy?

She\\'s too modest \\n               to talk about it, but she thinks we \\n               should get out of the convent and into \\n               the neighborhood more.\\n                             (putting her hands on \\n                             Mother Superior\\'s \\n                             shoulders) \\n               This woman.\\n\\n     Mary Patrick jumps forward.\\n\\n                               MARY PATRICK\\n               Bless her!

CONVENT - DAY\\n\\n     The nuns are out in force, painting the walls of the \\n     convent, mostly with rainbows and flowers and bright, \\n     shining suns.  The CAMERA PANS to Christy, who is adding \\n     her own original touch to the mural, using cans of spray \\n     paint.  Christy\\'s section includes an image of a nun in a \\n     miniskirt and spike heels, accompanied by neon letters that \\n     read \"St. Kate!\"  People gather in the street, watching the \\n     nuns\\' activities.  The convent begins to crackle with \\n     energy and life.\\n\\n     A drug deal is going on in a house up the street, but the \\n     DEALERS give only a curious glance to the action at the \\n     convent.\\n\\n     INT. MOTHER SUPERIOR\\'S WINDOW\\n\\n     From the window of her office, Mother Superior watches the \\n     painters and feels her control slipping away.\\n\\n     EXT. STREET - LATER\\n\\n     Christy leads the members of the choir down the middle of \\n     the street.  They get lots of attention each step of the \\n     way.

REHEARSAL ROOM - DAY\\n\\n     The rehearsal room is filled with high energy as the choir \\n     is separated into several groups.  Christy has got the \\n     whole thing running like a disciplined Broadway cast.\\n\\n     Mary Patrick leads one group in the corner as they \\n     practice synchronized movements with tambourines.  Colorful \\n     streamers are tied to the tambourines, and they make \\n     colorful patterns in the air.\\n\\n     Sister Alma pounds the piano with newfound energy, as Mary \\n     Robert and the sopranos reach higher and higher for notes \\n     they\\'ve only dreamed of in the past.\\n\\n     Christy and Mary Lazarus have corralled the rest of the \\n     nuns into a practice of intricate dance steps, somewhat \\n     like the Temptations in skirts.

You have \\n               raised the Sisters\\' expectations, you \\n               have excited and confused them.

Three more candles appear, carried by \\n     Mary Robert, Mary Patrick and Mary Lazarus.  The door to \\n     the freezer opens, and light spills out.

I was sort of \\n               selfish and... not real helpful.  Okay, \\n               I\\'ll say it -- I wasn\\'t much of a nun. \\n               But now, thanks to all of you... maybe \\n               I\\'m shaping up.\\n\\n                               MARY ROBERT\\n               Mary Clarence, don\\'t be silly.  You\\'re \\n               an example to us all.  You\\'ve taught us \\n               so much.  We\\'re singing for the \\n               Cardinals, and then -- who knows?  Maybe \\n               the choir can travel -- to schools, and \\n               nursing homes.\\n\\n                               MARY PATRICK\\n               Maybe we can get some of the local kids \\n               to sing with us.\\n\\n                               MARY LAZARUS\\n               We could cut a demo.

Of \\n               course, we never know when things are \\n               going to change.  Any one of us could be \\n               transferred to another convent, tomorrow.\\n\\n                               MARY ROBERT\\n                             (worried)\\n               Are you leaving us?\\n\\n                               CHRISTY\\n                             (sincerely)\\n               Oh no.  We\\'ll always be together.\\n\\n                               MARY LAZARUS\\n               That\\'s what Diana Ross said.\\n\\n     Page 88.\\n\\n     Christy and the nuns qiggle, and continue eating their ice \\n     cream, in a spirit of true friendship.\\n\\n     Mother Superior watches this scene, hidden in the shadows \\n     by the door to the kitchen.  She has begun to see Christy \\n     in a new light.  She looks thoughtful, and walks off.\\n\\n     INT. LAS VEGAS POLICE DEPARTMENT - DAY\\n\\n     Tate sits at his desk in the detective room, reading the \\n     sports section.  HENRY PARKER, the accountant for the \\n     police department, looks stressful as he enters the room \\n     and heads for Eddie\\'s glassed-in office.  Tate glances up \\n     as Parker passes his desk.\\n\\n                               TATE\\n               You\\'re too late.

He\\'ll sign \\'em later.\\n\\n     Parker looks annoyed -- he doesn\\'t like deviations from \\n     procedure -- but after a moment of indecision, he sets the \\n     file folder on Tate\\'s desk and walks away.\\n\\n     Tate finishes the newspaper and shoves it aside.  Bored, \\n     looks at his watch, then flips the file folder open and \\n     glances at its contents;  routine money vouchers for \\n     equipment, supplies, etc.  Tate is about to close the \\n     folder and shove it aside when something catches his eye.\\n\\n                               TATE\\n               What the hell is this...?\\n\\n     He examines a money voucher for a generous donation to St. \\n     Katherine\\'s Convent in San Francisco.  It only takes a \\n     moment to put two and two together, and Tate scrambles for \\n     his phone and dials a number.\\n\\n     INT. CORRIDOR\\n\\n     Henry Parker waits for the elevator.  When it opens, he\\'s \\n     surprised to see Eddie step out.\\n\\n                               PARKER\\n               Tate said you were gone.\\n\\n                               EDDIE\\n               I get all the way down to my car, and, \\n               of course -- where are the keys?\\n\\n     Page 89.\\n\\n                               PARKER\\n               I left the money vouchers with him.  He \\n               said you\\'d sign them in the morning.\\n\\n     Eddie nods and moves on as Parker enters the elevator. \\n     After a few steps, Eddie suddenly looks disturbed.  He \\n     picks up his pace.  A little panicky, he begins to jog \\n     toward the squad room.\\n\\n     INT. VINCE\\'S OFFICE\\n\\n     Vince is on the telephone.  He signals Joey and Willy, and \\n     they move quickly toward him.\\n\\n                               VINCE\\n               This is it.  Get ready to move.  No \\n               mistakes.  Grab her, get her to the \\n               Moonlight.  We meet there, and we take \\n               care of her.\\n                             (into phone)\\n               We\\'re on it.  Give me the address.\\n\\n     Vince begins to write down the address.\\n\\n     INT. SQUAD ROOM\\n\\n     Tate is hunched over the telephone, talking quietly with \\n     his back to the rest of the room.  The voucher for St. \\n     Katherine\\'s is in his hand as Eddie moves quickly toward \\n     him.\\n\\n                               TATE\\n               St. Katherine\\'s Convent on East Barton. \\n               It\\'s gotta be the place.\\n\\n     Tate hangs up the phone and BOOM!  Eddie hits him from \\n     behind like a linebacker, drilling him to the floor.  Other \\n     detectives look up from their desks with confusion and \\n     alarm.  Eddie pins Tate to the wall and snatches the \\n     voucher from his hand.\\n\\n                               EDDIE\\n               You\\'re the leak, you son-of-a-bitch!\\n\\n     Clarkson and another detective restrain Eddie before he \\n     can hit Tate.\\n\\n                               EDDIE\\n               Get him out of here!  Downstairs, in the \\n               cell!  I want his ass locked up now!\\n\\n     Nobody dares even question Eddie at this moment, and two \\n     detectives drag Tate away.  Eddie grabs Tate\\'s phone and \\n     dials long distance.\\n\\n                               EDDIE\\n               Clarkson, get on the other line.  Call \\n               Frisco Central.  Tell \\'em to get two \\n               squad cars outside St. Katherine\\'s \\n               convent, and stop anybody with an out-of-\\n               state license plate from getting near the \\n               place.\\n\\n     Clarkson dials quickly.

WOMEN\\'S ROOM\\n\\n     Christy enters the bathroom; it is deserted.  She fondles \\n     her rosary beads, and sinks to her knees.  This position \\n     doesn\\'t work for her; she stands.  She looks around her; \\n     she glances up, toward heaven.  She decides to do things \\n     simply, and speaks in a matter-of-fact tone.\\n\\n     Page 95.\\n\\n                               CHRISTY\\n               Okay, it\\'s me.  Mary Clarence.  Christy. \\n               It\\'s Chris Carter.  I need some help \\n               here.  I can\\'t believe I\\'m doing this. \\n               Okay, look, I know I should just get back \\n               in the car, and get the hell out of here.  \\n               Save my skin.  I mean, it\\'s not wrong, \\n               Vince really wants to kill me. Why do you \\n               make guys like Vince?  But if I don\\'t \\n               sing at St. Matthew\\'s... Mary Robert.  \\n               Mary Patrick.  It means so much to them.  \\n               They\\'re counting on me -- and I like \\n               that.  Maybe Reverend Mother is right, \\n               maybe I am a bad influence, maybe I\\'m \\n               just some Vegas slut, but... can we cut a \\n               deal here?  I mean, I still don\\'t believe \\n               in, like, most of the Commandments, and \\n               stuff in church still gives me the \\n               willies, but -- if I go back and sing, if \\n               I do a good deed, will you promise I \\n               won\\'t get killed?  All I want is a sign.  \\n               Lightning.  Thunder. Anything.\\n\\n     Suddenly, Christy hears the toilet FLUSH in the next \\n     bathroom.\\n\\n                               CHRISTY\\n                             (in disbelief)\\n               No.  No.  Doesn\\'t count...\\n\\n     Suddenly, Christy hears \"AVE MARIA\" coming from a radio or \\n     TV outside the bathroom.  She looks up; a ray of sunlight \\n     illuminates a grimy, dime-store Christmas tree ornament \\n     hanging from a room deodorizer.  The ornament is a glittery \\n     angel; it sparkles in the light.\\n\\n     Christy leaves the bathroom, still not quite sure.\\n\\n     EXT. GAS STATION\\n\\n     Christy looks through the grimy window of the gas station \\n     office.  A bored Mechanic is watching a small portable TV. \\n     On the TV is an episode of \"THE FLYING NUN\":  Sally Field, \\n     in full habit, is soaring along.\\n\\n     Suddenly, Christy hears the loud ROAR of a motorcycle \\n     starting up over by one of the gas pumps.  The BIKER turns \\n     and looks at Christy:  he has long hair, and a beard and \\n     moustache, and he looks, well, a bit like Jesus.\\n\\n                               CHRISTY\\n               Oh my God...\\n\\n     Christy runs up to the Biker..\\n\\n                               CHRISTY\\n               I\\'m late for church.  Can I get a lift?\\n\\n     Page 96.\\n\\n     Christy swings onto the back seat; the Biker puts his \\n     Harley in gear and flies down the street.  Eddie is shocked \\n     as he drops some money on the ground and jumps into his car \\n     to follow.\\n\\n     EXT. ST.

CHAPEL\\n\\n     There is a sense of chaos in the chapel as TECHNICIANS set \\n     up television equipment, and Mother Superior leads the \\n     choir as it rehearses.  Near the back of the chapel, Bishop \\n     O\\'Hara looks concerned over the performance of the choir. A \\n     CARDINAL walks up to Bishop O\\'Hara.\\n\\n                               CARDINAL\\n               Is this the choir you\\'ve been speaking \\n               so highly of, Bishop?\\n\\n                               O\\'HARA\\n               They\\'re just a bit nervous.

Pull yourselves \\n               together.\\n\\n     Clapping his hands briskly, the FLOOR DIRECTOR suddenly \\n     steps forward from behind the TV cameras and hustles the \\n     choir away from the altar.\\n\\n                               FLOOR DIRECTOR\\n               Okay, Sisters, we have to move on now. \\n               That was great, just great.
